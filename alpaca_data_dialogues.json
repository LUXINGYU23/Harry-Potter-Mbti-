Are you up yet? Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. What did you say? Bad news, Vernon, Mrs. Figg’s broken her leg. She can’t take him. Now what? Don’t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy. On vacation in Majorca, And come back and find the house in ruins? I suppose we could take him to the zoo, Dinky Duddydums, don’t cry, Mummy won’t let him spoil your special day! Oh, good Lord, they’re here! Your new school uniform, Don’t be stupid, I’m dyeing some of Dudley’s old things gray for you. It’ll look just like everyone else’s when I’ve finished. Vernon! Oh my goodness — Vernon! I’m not sure that’ll work, Vernon. Knew! Knew! Of course we knew! How could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was? Oh, she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that — that school — and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the only one who saw her for what she was — a freak! she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you! There’s more in the frying pan, sweetums, We must build you up while we’ve got the chance. . . . I don’t like the sound of that school food. . . . Very true, Duddy’s got to make himself smart for his auntie, Mummy’s bought him a lovely new bow tie. Get the door! Maybe they think they’ll get invited to dinner if they’re late. What is it? What is it, Vernon? At the Polkisses’, He’s got so many little friends, he’s so popular . . . You’re a nasty little liar.

You could just leave me here, I won’t blow up the house, I had a dream about a motorcycle, It was flying. I know they don’t, It was only a dream. What’s this? Oh, I didn’t realize it had to be so wet. Make Dudley get it. That’s mine! I want to read it, as it’s mine. I WANT MY LETTER! It was not a mistake, it had my cupboard on it. Why? AAAAARRRGH! I want — Who are you? I’m sorry, but I still don’t really know who you are. All what? What world? What? My — my mum and dad weren’t famous, were they? Kept what from me? I’m a what? What does it mean, they await my owl? A what? Blown up? You told me they died in a car crash! But why? What happened? Who? Why not? Could you write it down? But what happened to Vol-, sorry — I mean, You-Know-Who? Hagrid, I think you must have made a mistake. I don’t think I can be a wizard. Why aren’t you supposed to do magic? Why were you expelled? It was a dream, I dreamed a giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards. When I open my eyes I’ll be at home in my cupboard. And there’s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door,  All right, I’m getting up. What? What? Knuts? Um — Hagrid? I haven’t got any money — and you heard Uncle Vernon last night . . . he won’t pay for me to go and learn magic. But if their house was destroyed — Wizards have banks? Goblins? Goblins? Goblins? Goblins? Goblins? Goblins? Goblins? Goblins? Goblins? Goblins? How did you get here? Flew? Of course not, Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts? There’s a Ministry of Magic? But what does a Ministry of Magic do? What? Why? You’d like one? Can we buy all this in London? What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell? Is he always that nervous? What’s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen? I never know, what’s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite? Yes, No, No, No, No, No, That’s Hagrid, He works at Hogwarts. He’s the gamekeeper, I think he’s brilliant, They’re dead, They were a witch and wizard, if that’s what you mean. Nothing, Don’t make me feel worse, — and he said people from Muggle families shouldn’t even be allowed in — So what is Quidditch? And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff? Vol-, sorry — You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts? I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley. You don’t have to — Hello, Oh, Everyone thinks I’m special, . . but I don’t know anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I’m famous and I can’t even remember what I’m famous for. I don’t know what happened when Vol-, sorry — I mean, the night my parents died. “Er — Uncle Vernon?” Er — I need to be at King’s Cross tomorrow to — to go to Hogwarts.” “Thank you.” I don’t know,”  “I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven o’clock,” “It’s on my ticket.” “Why are you going to London?” Excuse me, Yes, Er — okay, “Yes, please,” “Thanks,” “What?” Yes, but I can’t remember it. Well — I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else. Are all your family wizards? So you must know loads of magic already.  Horrible — well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are, though. Wish I’d had three wizard brothers. . . . and until Hagrid told me, I didn’t know anything about being a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort — What? I’m not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name, I just never knew you shouldn’t.  See what I mean? I’ve got loads to learn. . . . I bet, I bet I’m the worst in the class. Starving, Go on, have a pasty, “What “What So this is Dumbledore! Can I have a frog? I might get Agrippa — thanks — He’s gone! But in, you know, the Muggle world, people just stay put in photos.” “He’ll turn up,” “Harry Potter,” “Am I?” “What House are your brothers in?” “That’s the House Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?” “You know, I think the ends of Scabbers’ whiskers are a bit lighter,” “So what do your oldest brothers do now that they’ve left, anyway?” “Really? What happened to them?” “Er — I don’t know any,” Yes,” “I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,” “Unless you get out now,” You’ve met Malfoy before? How exactly do they sort us into Houses? Not Slytherin, not Slytherin. “Is he — a bit mad? “Can’t you — ?” Ouch!” “N-nothing.” “Who’s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?” He’s not serious? I don’t know, sir, I don’t know, sir, “This is Ron,” “But he seemed to really hate me.” Hagrid Typical, Just what I always wanted. To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy. Give that here, Malfoy, Give it here! Give it here, or I’ll knock you off that broom! No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy, — a century, Wood told me. I start training next week, Only don’t tell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret. You’re a lot braver now that you’re back on the ground and you’ve got your little friends with you, And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?” And it’s really none of your business, “Come on,” Go away. “How’s your arm?” “Good — well, look, Neville, we’ve got to be somewhere, we’ll see you later —” “This way!” “RUN!” “I think we’ve lost him,” “Let’s go.” “Shut up, Peeves — please — you’ll get us thrown out.” “Not if you don’t give us away, Peeves, please.” “Never mind that — pig snout, pig snout,” I wasn’t looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads. Or both, A Nimbus Two Thousand, sir, And it’s really thanks to Malfoy here that I’ve got it, “I thought you weren’t speaking to us?” Three Chasers, The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score, So — that’s sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn’t it? Never mind, Three Chasers, one Keeper, And they play with the Quaffle. Er — have the Bludgers ever killed anyone? “I think she heard you.” “How could a troll get in?” “What about her?” “He’s heading for the third floor,” The key’s in the lock, We could lock it in. Yes! It’s the girls’ bathroom! Confuse it! Come on, run, run! I don’t think so, I think it’s just been knocked out. Urgh – troll boogers. Five, you mean, once she’s taken off Hermione’s. She might not have needed saving if we hadn’t locked the thing in with her, I just wondered if I could have my book back. He tried to get past that three-headed dog at Halloween! That’s where he was going when we saw him — he’s after whatever it’s guarding! And I’d bet my broomstick he let that troll in, to make a diversion! I don’t want anything. I’m not hungry. Thanks, Seamus I’ve got the Snitch! “Fluffy?” “Fluffy?” “Fluffy?” “Yes?” But Snape’s trying to steal it. I hate them both, Malfoy and Snape. Oh, we’re not working, Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we’ve been trying to find out who he is. Unless you’d like to tell us and save us the trouble? We must’ve been through hundreds of books already and we can’t find him anywhere — just give us a hint — I know I’ve read his name somewhere. Nothing, You, too, Will you look at this? I’ve got some presents! That’s friendly, “Hagrid and my aunt and uncle — so who sent these?” “That’s really nice of her,”  “What is it?” Nothing, You can come tonight, I’m going back, I want to show you the mirror. And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you’ll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone. It’s here — just here — yes! “See?” “Look! Look at them all . . . there are loads of them. . . .” “Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.” “Can you see all your family standing around you?” “What?” “How can it? All my family are dead — let me have another look —” “You’re only holding the Quidditch Cup, what’s interesting about that? I want to see my parents.” “Quick!” No. No . . . you go . . . “Why not?” You sound like Hermione. I — I didn’t see you, sir. I didn’t know it was called that, sir. It — well — it shows me my family — How did you know — ? It shows us what we want . . . whatever we want . . . Sir — Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something? What do you see when you look in the mirror? Don’t talk to me for a moment, I can’t, There isn’t a reserve Seeker. If I back out, Gryffindor can’t play at all. You’re worth twelve of Malfoy, The Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn’t it? And where’s Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin. Dumbledore again, “I’m going to play,” “If I don’t, all the Slytherins will think I’m just too scared to face Snape.   I’ll show them . . . it’ll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win.” “Dumbledore?” Never mind that now, Let’s find an empty room, you wait ’til you hear this. . . . So we were right, it is the Sorcerer’s Stone, and Snape’s trying to force Quirrell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy — and he said something about Quirrell’s ‘hocus-pocus’— I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through — Hermione, the exams are ages away. “See you later, then,” “Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone?” Hagrid’s always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever met him, “But there aren’t wild dragons in Britain?” Yes, We were wondering if you could tell us what’s guarding the Sorcerer’s Stone apart from Fluffy. “Hagrid — what’s that?” Shut up! Hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face — he leapt to his feet and ran to the window. “Charlie,” “Charlie,” “Charlie,” No — Charlie — your brother, Charlie. In Romania. Studying dragons. We could send Norbert to him. Charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the wild!” She’ll have Charlie’s answer! We’ve got the Invisibility Cloak, It shouldn’t be too difficult — I think the cloak’s big enough to cover two of us and Norbert. Charlie We’ve got the Invisibility Cloak, Nearly there! Don’t, Well, well, well, we are in trouble. Fifty? Professor — please — You can’t — They’ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though, have they? No, we’ve done enough poking around. Is that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started. “Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?” “A werewolf?” “D’you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?” “Did that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask me, that was what’s bin killin’ the unicorns — never heard anythin’ like it before.” “Look —” “Yes — thank you — what was that?” “No,” We’ve only used the horn and tail hair in Potions.” “The Sorcerer’s Stone! Of course — the Elixir of Life! But I don’t understand who —” “Snape wants the Stone for Voldemort . . . and Voldemort’s waiting in the forest . . . and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich. . . .” “Firenze saved me, but he shouldn’t have done so. . . . Bane was furious . . . he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen. . . . They must show that Voldemort’s coming back. . . . Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me. . . . I suppose that’s written in the stars as well.” “We’ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.” “No, we’re in a hurry. Hagrid, I’ve got to ask you something. You know that night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like?” “What did you talk to him about, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts at all?” “And did he — did he seem interested in Fluffy?” “We’ll just have to —” It’s sort of secret,” “But this is important.” “Professor, I think — I know — that Sn — that someone’s going to try and steal the Stone. I’ve got to talk to Professor Dumbledore.” “But Professor —” “We were —” “At least Hermione’s on Snape’s tail,” “I’m going out of here tonight and I’m going to try and get to the Stone first.” “Oh, come off it, you don’t think we’d let you go alone?” “But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.” “We’d better put the Cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of us — if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own —” “Nothing, Neville, nothing,” “What’ve you done to him?” “If anything happens to me, don’t follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?” “See you in a minute, I hope. . . .” “Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it’s here to break the fall. Come on, Hermione!” “Well, hurry up, I can’t breathe!” “So light a fire!” “Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,” “This way,” “I don’t know . . . sounds like wings to me.” yes — look! Broomsticks! We’ve got to catch the key to the door!” “We’re looking for a big, old-fashioned one — probably silver, like the handle.” “Ron, you come at it from above — Hermione, stay below and stop it from going down — and I’ll try and catch it. Right, NOW!” “Now what do we do?” “What about you?” “But —” “Ron —” But so will we, won’t we? But how do we know which to drink? There’s only enough there for one of us, That’s hardly one swallow. Which one will get you back through the purple flames? “Ron —” No, listen, get back and get Ron. Grab brooms from the flying-key room, they’ll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy — go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need him. I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I’m no match for him, really. Hermione! I’m not as good as you, You drink first, You are sure which is which, aren’t you? It’s not poison? Quick, go, before it wears off. GO! “You!” But I thought — Snape — But Snape tried to kill me! Snape was trying to save me? You let the troll in? I saw you and Snape in the forest — But Snape always seemed to hate me so much. But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing — I thought Snape was threatening you. . . . You mean he was there in the classroom with you? I don’t understand . . . is the Stone inside the mirror? Should I break it?” I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore, I — I’ve won the House Cup for Gryffindor. LIAR! NEVER! Sir! The Stone! It was Quirrell! He’s got the Stone! Sir, quick — Then who does? Sir, I — How long have I been in here? But sir, the Stone — You got there? You got Hermione’s owl? It was you. You nearly were, I couldn’t have kept him off the Stone much longer — But that means he and his wife will die, won’t they? Sir, there are some other things I’d like to know, if you can tell me . . . things I want to know the truth about. . . . Well . . . Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me. But why would he want to kill me in the first place? But why couldn’t Quirrell touch me? And the Invisibility Cloak — do you know who sent it to me? And there’s something else . . . Quirrell said Snape — Yes, him — Quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father. Is that true? What? He saved his life. And sir, there’s one more thing . . . How did I get the Stone out of the mirror? Just five minutes, You let Professor Dumbledore in. . . . I am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go on, Madam Pomfrey . . . So what happened to you two? No, it isn’t, He’s a funny man, Dumbledore. I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I don’t think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked. It’s almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could. . . . Hagrid, he’d have found out somehow, this is Voldemort we’re talking about, he’d have found out even if you hadn’t told him. VOLDEMORT! I’ve met him and I’m calling him by his name. Please cheer up, Hagrid, we saved the Stone, it’s gone, he can’t use it. Have a Chocolate Frog, I’ve got loads. . . . It’s not a stoat sandwich, is it? You’ve forgotten the magic word, But I — I just —” All right, all right . . . What? “Better not let your mum hear you talking about my school,” “I’m trying to decide what would be the best spell to set it on fire,” “Jiggery pokery!” Er — hello, “Sit down,” Sorry, Don’t — what are you doing? Your family? Do they know you’re here? But won’t they notice if you shut your ears in the oven door? But why don’t you leave? Escape?” And I thought I had it bad staying here for another four weeks,” This makes the Dursleys sound almost human.  Can’t anyone help you? Can’t I?” Please, please be quiet. If the Dursleys hear anything, if they know you’re here — Whatever you’ve heard about my greatness is a load of rubbish. I’m not even top of my year at Hogwarts; that’s Hermione, she — Voldemort? Sorry, I know lots of people don’t like it. My friend Ron — Why?  Not — not He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, sir — He hasn’t got a brother, has he? Dobby . . . please . . .” “I can’t —” “Ron, how did you — What the — ?” “It wasn’t me — and how did he know?” You should talk, “I told you, I didn’t — but it’ll take too long to explain now — But you can’t magic me out either — If the Dursleys wake up, I’m dead, But all my Hogwarts stuff — my wand — my broomstick — Locked in the cupboard under the stairs, and I can’t get out of this room — Watch out for the bottom stair — it creaks, “I’ve forgotten Hedwig!” See you next summer! I don’t think he could, I told you, every time he got close to letting something slip, he started banging his head against the wall. What, you think he was lying to me? Yes, Draco Malfoy, He hates me. “I don’t know whether the Malfoys own a house-elf. . . .” “Who’s Errol?” Who? Who? Who? So, does your dad know you’ve got the car? What does your dad do at the Ministry of Magic, anyway? The what?  But your dad — this car — It’s wonderful, I’ll help Ron. I’ve never seen a de-gnoming — Muggles have garden gnomes, too, you know, Your Quidditch team? This is the best house I’ve ever been in. W-what am I supposed to do? I went on the Underground — The right what? D-Dia-gon Alley, Ha! I’m fine, thanks, Malfoy and his father. No, he was selling — The Dursleys haven’t given me pocket money for about six years. I think we’d better go and wait by the car, “What about it?” “But I thought —” “Okay,” Er — Well, we haven’t been expelled, “What’s the matter?” “What’s a Howler?” “What’ve we got this afternoon?” “Shut up,” Haven’t even started, Wood’s been teaching us new moves. No idea, He’s in Gryffindor, “We’d better get him to Hagrid’s, it’s nearest,” What did Lockhart want with you, Hagrid? Bet he didn’t like that, I’d swap anytime, I’ve had loads of practice with the Dursleys. Answering Lockhart’s fan mail . . . he’ll be a nightmare. . . . So do you,  Oh — yes, “What is it?” “Of — of course,” “Can you taste it if you walk through it?” “Hello, Peeves,” “She did —” “Oh, yes,” Let’s go, It’s that voice again — shut up a minute — Listen! SHH! And I don’t even know what a Squib is. because we were tired and wanted to go to bed, D’you think I should have told them about that voice I heard? You do believe me, don’t you? And what on earth’s a Squib? Why do you want it? What’s that? Not Slytherin! “Hullo, Colin,” “That I’m Slytherin’s heir, I expect,” “What’s up?” Remember all that water on the floor? Where did that come from? Someone’s mopped it up.” “What’s the matter?” Ask her if she saw anything, Nothing, Did you see anyone near here that night? Look at his family, The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin; he’s always boasting about it. They could easily be Slytherin’s descendants. His father’s definitely evil enough. But how do we prove it? But that’s impossible, Ready? D’you realize how much we’re going to have to steal, Hermione? Shredded skin of a boomslang, that’s definitely not in the students’ cupboard. What’re we going to do, break into Snape’s private stores? I don’t know if this is a good idea. . . . How long will it take to make, anyway? If we stop now, we’ll have to forfeit the match! And we’re not losing to Slytherin just because of a crazy Bludger! Come on, Oliver, tell them to leave me alone! Ah, You will be able to, won’t you? You nearly got Ron and me expelled, You’d better get lost before my bones come back, Dobby, or I might strangle you. Why d’you wear that thing, Dobby? Oh, is that all? I don’t suppose you’re going to tell me why you wanted me sent home in pieces? So there is a Chamber of Secrets? And — did you say it’s been opened before? Tell me, Dobby! But I’m not Muggle-born — how can I be in danger from the Chamber? You haven’t seen Ron or Hermione, have you? “Who cares?” “Rictusempra!” Professor, could you show me that blocking thing again? You wish, “What, drop my wand?” Hello, I’m looking for Justin Finch-Fletchley. I wanted to tell him what really happened with that snake at the Dueling Club, Then you noticed that after I spoke to it, the snake backed off? It’s nothing, I’d better get going, Hagrid, it’s Transfiguration next and I’ve got to pick up my books. Professor, You’re wrong, Professor, You don’t think it was me, Professor? But I still want to talk to you. Are you sure? Hermione, I don’t think — Oh, Ready? One — two — three — Hermione, are you okay?” “We’ll meet you back here, all right?” Don’t swing your arms like that, Crabbe holds them sort of stiff. . . . Yeah, that’s better. . . . “Any ideas?” Er — “Ha, ha,” “You must have some idea who’s behind it all. . . .” D’you know if the person who opened the Chamber last time was caught?” “Azkaban?” “Hermione, come out, we’ve got loads to tell you —” It’s okay, Hermione, We’ll take you up to the hospital wing. Madam Pomfrey never asks too many questions. . . . That’s Filch, Let’s go and see, What’s up, Myrtle?  Why would I throw something at you? But it can’t hurt you if someone throws something at you, I mean, it’d just go right through you, wouldn’t it? Who threw it at you, anyway? What? All right, I’ve got the point, Well, we won’t find out unless we look at it, How on earth d’you know that? I wish I knew why someone did try to chuck it, I wouldn’t mind knowing how Riddle got an award for special services to Hogwarts either. “Not here,” “Let me go!” “Expelliarmus!” It was Hagrid, Ron. Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty years ago. “He was buying a Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent,” “I just want to give up Potions,” Exactly, What does she understand? But why’s she got to go to the library? I think, it’s time to get my dad’s old Cloak out again. “What’s that for?” “Looks like they’re heading for the Forbidden Forest. . . .” “We weren’t there, remember?” Let’s do it tonight. “C’mon, Fang, we’re going for a walk,” “Lumos!” “What d’you reckon?” What? We’ve lost the trail, C’mon, let’s go and find them. We’re friends of Hagrid’s, They think, up at the school, that Hagrid’s been setting a — a — something on students. They’ve taken him to Azkaban. And you . . . you didn’t come from the Chamber of Secrets? So you never — never attacked anyone? But then . . . Do you know what did kill that girl? Because whatever it is, it’s back and attacking people again — What? We’ll just go, then, “But — but —” I bet he thought Aragog wouldn’t hurt friends of his, He was innocent. “What is it? “Is it something about the Chamber of Secrets? Have you seen something? Someone acting oddly?” “I agree, sir,” “Hermione, “Hermione, “Because if he sneaked up on them all, no one’ll ever know. . . .” “Ron,” “The basilisk kills people by looking at them. But no one’s died — because no one looked it straight in the eye. Colin saw it through his camera. The basilisk burned up all the film inside it, but Colin just got Petrified. Justin . . . Justin must’ve seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick! Nick got the full blast of it, but he couldn’t die again . . . and Hermione and that Ravenclaw prefect were found with a mirror next to them. Hermione had just realized the monster was a basilisk. I bet you anything she warned the first person she met to look around corners with a mirror first! And that girl pulled out her mirror — and —” Ron “— Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom,” This means, I can’t be the only Parselmouth in the school. The Heir of Slytherin’s one, too. That’s how he’s been controlling the basilisk. Let’s go to the staffroom, She’ll be there in ten minutes. It’s nearly break. Professor, we’ve got some information for you, We think it’ll help you. Expelliarmus! Shouldn’t have let Professor Snape teach us that one, You’re in luck, We think we know where it is. And what’s inside it. Let’s go. “To ask you how you died,” How? Where exactly did you see the eyes? “But —” Open up, Open up, I’m going down there, We must be miles under the school, Let’s go. Remember, any sign of movement, close your eyes right away. . . . Maybe it’s asleep, Wait there, Wait with Lockhart. I’ll go on. . . . If I’m not back in an hour . . . See you in a bit, Open up, “Are you a ghost?” You’ve got to help me, Tom, We’ve got to get her out of here.  There’s a basilisk .. . I don’t know where it is, but it could be along any moment. . . . Please, help me — Thanks, Listen, We’ve got to go! If the basilisk comes — What d’you mean, What d’you mean, I won’t be — ? Look, I don’t think you get it. We’re in the Chamber of Secrets. We can talk later — How did Ginny get like this? What are you talking about? What d’you mean? No, And why did you want to meet me? Hagrid’s my friend, And you framed him, didn’t you? I thought you made a mistake, but — I bet Dumbledore saw right through you, Well, you haven’t finished it, “You’re not,” “He’s not as gone as you might think!” “Fawkes?” “Don’t leave me!” He’s Dumbledore’s, I’ll explain when we get out of here, “Have you thought how we’re going to get back up this?” There’s no need to sound so disappointed, It was this diary, Riddle wrote it when he was sixteen. . . . “Professor Dumbledore . . . Riddle said I’m like him. Strange likenesses, he said. . . .” “Voldemort put a bit of himself in me?” “So I should be in Slytherin,” “The Sorting Hat could see Slytherin’s power in me, and it —” “Don’t you want to know how Ginny got hold of that diary, Mr. Malfoy?” “Because you gave it to her,” “In Flourish and Blotts. You picked up her old Transfiguration book and slipped the diary inside it, didn’t you?” Least I could do, Dobby, Just promise never to try and save my life again. I’ve just got one question, Dobby, You told me all this had nothing to do with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, remember? Well — Right, Well, I’d better go. There’s a feast, and my friend Hermione should be awake by now. . . . Aunt Marge? Sh — she’s not coming here, is she? All right, if she does when she’s talking to me. I will if she does, What? Like I wanted to come, I want to ask you something. I need you to sign the permission form, Well, it’ll be hard work, pretending to Aunt Marge I go to that St. Whatsits — Exactly, It’s a lot to remember. I’ll have to make it sound convincing, won’t I? What if I accidentally let something slip? Knocking the stuffing out of me won’t make Aunt Marge forget what I could tell her, But if you sign my permission form, I swear I’ll remember where I’m supposed to go to school, and I’ll act like a Mug — like I’m normal and everything. Hedwig, you’re going to have to clear off for a week. Go with Errol.Ron’ll look after you. I’ll write him a note, explaining. And don’t look at me like that Yes, Yes, All the time. Oh, yeah, loads of times. He was not, They didn’t die in a car crash! She deserved it, She deserved what she got. You keep away from me. I’m going, I’ve had enough. Fell over, I didn’t do it on purpose, There was a big black thing, Like a dog .. . but massive . . . Nothing, Neville Longbottom, So — so this bus, did you say it goes anywhere? Yes, Listen, how much would it be to get to London? How come the Muggles don’t hear the bus? What? Sorry, Sorry, I — I forgot — So — so Black was a supporter of You-Know-Who? — all You-Know-’Oo’s supporters was tracked down, wasn’t they, Ern? Most of ’em knew it was all over, wiv You-Know-’Oo gone, and they came quiet. But not Sirius Black. I ’eard he thought ’e’d be second-in-command once You-Know-’Oo ’ad taken over. “What?” Diagon Alley, Thanks, Well, ’Bye then! ’Bye, I always stay at Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays, and I don’t ever want to go back to Privet Drive. Hang on, What about my punishment? I broke the law! The Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry! Last year, I got an official warning just because a house-elf smashed a pudding in my uncle’s house! The Ministry of Magic said I’d be expelled from Hogwarts if there was any more magic there! Of course I don’t, Okay, but why — ? Er — Minister? Can I ask you something? Okay, D’you think you could — ? Ah, “Hedwig!” Hang on, I’ve already got one of those. Yes, I need Unfogging the Future by Cassandra Vablatsky. Yes, Er — I need Intermediate Transfiguration and The Standard Book of Spells, Grade Three. It can’t have been a death omen, I was panicking when I saw that thing in Magnolia Crescent. . . . It was probably just a stray dog. . . . I got all my school stuff last week, And how come you knew I’m staying at the Leaky Cauldron? I didn’t mean to, I just — lost control. So am I, Forget expelled, I thought I was going to be arrested. Your dad doesn’t know why Fudge let me off, does he? Excellent! So, have you got all your new books and stuff? What’s all that, Hermione? Are you planning to eat or sleep at all this year, Hermione? It was either a very big cat or quite a small tiger, Probably getting her owl — Fine, thanks, They still haven’t caught him, then? It’d be good to get some more money — Hello Okay, “What’s up?” I’ll get Scabbers’s stuff, I’m packed, I’ve got something to tell you, Later, It’s all right, Mr. Weasley, I already know. Oh, No — honestly, it’s okay. This way, you haven’t broken your word to Fudge and I know what’s going on. I’m not, Really, — that I’ll be a good boy and stay in the castle? What?” Why would I go looking for someone I know wants to kill me? I need to talk to you in private, I don’t go looking for trouble, Trouble usually finds me. ’Spect it will, You’ll have to tell me when you’ve found out. I can’t go. The Dursleys didn’t sign my permission form, and Fudge wouldn’t either. Yeah, I expect that’s what McGonagall will say when I ask for permission, New teacher,  “What were you saying, Malfoy?” D’you think we’ve broken down? Hullo, Neville, No idea — sit down — Who’s that? Who’s that? Not here! I’m here! W-what? Yeah, What happened? Where’s that — that thing? Who screamed? “But I heard screaming —” What was that thing? Well — that thing — the dementor — stood there and looked around (I mean, I think it did, I couldn’t see its face) — and you — you — But didn’t any of you — fall off your seats? “Fine,” I’m not delicate! I’m fine! I’ve already had some, Professor Lupin gave me some. He gave it to all of us. Yes, You didn’t pass out, though, did you? Are you all right? Listen, we’re looking for the North Tower. You don’t know the way, do you? A load of soggy brown stuff, “The what?” When you’ve all finished deciding whether I’m going to die or not! Malfoy, Malfoy, I’ll do it, There’s a light on in Hagrid’s window, I’m allowed to walk across the grounds, Sirius Black hasn’t got past the dementors here, has he? He’s faking it, Madam Pomfrey can mend anything. She regrew half my bones last year. Trust Malfoy to milk it for all it’s worth. We’re witnesses, You said hippogriffs attack if you insult them. It’s Malfoy’s problem that he wasn’t listening. We’ll tell Dumbledore what really happened. What’s he done? So that’s why you’re putting it on, To try to get Hagrid fired. Where? Yeah, that’s right, Know what? What? What are you talking about? What did Malfoy mean? Why would I want revenge on Black? What? Er — because there are so many of us, it won’t know what shape it should be? But I didn’t do anything, Definitely, What’s happened? Yeah, I think I will, I’ve got Scabbers asleep in my bag. Yeah, great. Fortuna Major, Oh, I — I’ve got to go to the library, got to get some work done. Nothing, A likely story! Sneaking around on your own — why aren’t you in Hogsmeade buying Stink Pellets and Belch Powder and Whizzing Worms like the rest of your nasty little friends? “A what?” All right, How did you know about that? No, No, Why didn’t you let me fight it? Why? 原文无此句 But then, I — I remembered those dementors. Well . . . yeah, Professor Lupin, you know the dementors — Why? Professor Snape’s very interested in the Dark Arts, “Right,” Thanks, What’s Hogsmeade like? Where did you go? No, Lupin made me a cup of tea in his office. And then Snape came in. . . . I know he’s after me, I heard Ron’s dad telling his mum. Mr. Weasley works for the Ministry of Magic. We’ve got our first match on Saturday! I’ve got to train, Professor! There’s nothing wrong with Malfoy’s arm! He’s faking it! Sorry I’m late, Professor Lupin, I — Where’s Professor Lupin? What’s wrong with him? Snape’s never been like this with any of our other Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers, even if he did want the job, Why’s he got it in for Lupin? D’you think this is all because of the boggart? Why couldn’t Black have hidden in Snape’s office, eh? He could have finished him off for us! Oh, shut up, What’s the score? I’ve got no chance with these on, Brilliant! Stand aside, you silly girl . . . stand aside, now. . . . That was the scariest thing I’ve ever seen in my life. What happened? What happened? What happened? Are we doing a replay? Where is Wood? Did someone get my Nimbus? What? And? And? No, The tree smashed it to bits. Did you hear about the dementors too? Yes, Why? Why do they affect me like that? Am I just — ? Why did they have to come to the match? Azkaban must be terrible, But Sirius Black escaped from them, He got away. . . . But if the dementors come to another Quidditch match, I need to be able to fight them — What are you doing? How come you’re not going to Hogsmeade? What’s that supposed to be? And what do I need with a bit of old parchment? Don’t tell me — And you know how to work it? “You’re winding me up,” Dissendium! Lumos! Mischief managed! Definitely not, ’Course I haven’t, No, I’m not! If I hand it in, I’ll have to say where I got it! Filch would know Fred and George had nicked it! He can’t be getting in through a passage, There are seven secret tunnels on the map, right? Fred and George reckon Filch already knows about four of them. And of the other three — one of them’s caved in, so no one can get through it. One of them’s got the Whomping Willow planted over the entrance, so you can’t get out of it. And the one I just came through — well — it’s really hard to see the entrance to it down in the cellar, so unless he knew it was there . . . Are you going to report me? Where is everyone? I’m fine, Like what? I can hear my mum screaming and pleading with Voldemort. And if you’d heard your mum screaming like that, just about to be killed, you wouldn’t forget it in a hurry. And if you found out someone who was supposed to be a friend of hers betrayed her and sent Voldemort after her — — so obviously, the Malfoys knew Black was working for Voldemort — I’ll never know what they’d have wanted, because thanks to Black, I’ve never spoken to them, Yeah, let’s go, and I can ask him how come he never mentioned Black when he told me all about my parents! No! Hagrid! Hagrid, are you in there? What’s this, Hagrid? What about Dumbledore, Hagrid? Listen, Hagrid, you can’t give up. Hermione’s right, you just need a good defense. You can call us as witnesses — Here’s something . . . there was a case in 1722 . . . but the hippogriff was convicted — ugh, look what they did to it, that’s disgusting — Dunno . . . Look and see if there’s a card, Well, I’m betting it wasn’t the Dursleys. That was my dad’s, though, Dumbledore was just passing it on to me. He wouldn’t spend hundreds of Galleons on me. He can’t go giving students stuff like this — Which? What? Lupin? What d’you mean, he was away? He was ill when I was playing in that match. I can’t see Lupin affording something like this. No idea, There wasn’t a card or anything with it. I forgot about that! I never wear those socks if I can help it. . . . He’s not looking too good, is he? Coming? No, What? Why? There’s nothing wrong with it! Honestly, Professor — What d’you reckon’s the matter with him? What! Okay, How does it work? What does a Patronus look like? And how do you conjure it? Right, Expecto Patronum, Expecto Patronum. Expecto Patronum, Expecto Patronum Oh — yeah — Expecto Patronum, Expecto Patronum. Expecto Patrono — no, Patronum — sorry — Expecto Patronum, Expecto Patronum — Did you see that? Something happened! Yes, Expecto Patronum! Expecto Patronum! Expecto — Expecto Patronum! Expecto Pat — EXPECTO PATRONUM! EXPECTO PATRONUM! Sorry, Yes . . . It’s getting worse, I do! I’ve got to! What if the dementors turn up at our match against Ravenclaw? I can’t afford to fall off again. If we lose this game we’ve lost the Quidditch Cup! Ready, Expecto Patronum! Expecto Patronum! Expecto — Expecto Patronum! Expecto Pat — EXPECTO PATRONUM! EXPECTO PATRONUM! I heard my dad, That’s the first time I’ve ever heard him — he tried to take on Voldemort himself, to give my mum time to run for it. . . . Oh — yeah — Ah, No! I’ll have one more go! I’m not thinking of happy enough things, that’s what it is. . . . Hang on. . . . Expecto Patronum! Expecto Patronum! Expecto Patronum! EXPECTO PATRONUM! EXPECTO PATRONUM! Can we have another go? Just one more go? Fine, Professor Lupin? If you knew my dad, you must’ve known Sirius Black as well. Nothing — I mean, I just knew they were friends at Hogwarts too. . . . What! I’m not buying anything Malfoy thinks is good, You said it’s harder if there are loads of them, Butterbeer! Yeah, I like that stuff! Oh — Ron and Hermione brought me some back from Hogsmeade, What! What! What! He deserves it, Yes, For . . . for some things . . . Sorry, Professor — I can have it back? Seriously? Yeah . . . anything . . . ,  You know what — we should make up with Hermione. . . . She was only trying to help. . . . Oddsbodikins, I got it back, Can I sit down, then? How are you getting through all this stuff? Why don’t you just drop a couple of subjects? Arithmancy looks terrible, Yeah, that’s true, Yeah, I’m staying out for a bit; Ron wants a go on the Firebolt, Here you go, Yeah, reckon so, Pity you can’t attach an extra arm to yours, Malfoy, Then it could catch the Snitch for you. Expecto Patronum! The dementors didn’t affect me at all! I didn’t feel a thing! Right, Did you even come to the match? Come on, Hermione, come and have some food, I can’t, Harry. I’ve still got four hundred and twenty-two pages to read! Anyway . . . He doesn’t want me to join in. Can’t you give her a break? AAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGHHHHH! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! What’re you doing? Professor McGonagall told us to go to bed! D’you reckon we should tell someone? He must’ve known he’d have a job getting back out of the castle once you’d yelled and woken people up, He’d’ve had to kill the whole House to get back through the portrait hole . . . then he would’ve met the teachers. . . . Ouch! Oh — thanks, Hedwig. What are they for, Hagrid? What? Hagrid, we should’ve helped as well — sorry — Well, Filch hasn’t done anything about the passage into Honeydukes. . . . Okay, But I’m taking the Invisibility Cloak this time. It’s me, Snape was hanging around. . . . Leave him to me, See you later, “I don’t know, Professor.” No, No, SHUT UP! “I told you to shut up about my dad!” “I know the truth, all right? He saved your life! Dumbledore told me! You wouldn’t even be here if it wasn’t for my dad!” “Spare bit of parchment,” “No!” “No,” “Professor, I —” Why did Snape think I’d got it from the manufacturers? Do you know them? That’s weird, Maybe — maybe she went to the bathroom or something? Divination, but it’s not for another twenty minutes, Hermione, why didn’t you come to Charms? with Don’t complain, this means we’ve finished palmistry, I was getting sick of her flinching every time she looked at my hands. Flibbertigibbet I KNOW, OLIVER! Yeah . . . , Ron! Ron! Wake up! I need you to tell me if you can see something! Down here — “You —” Go! Go! Go!  YES! Yes, Yeah, Wish she’d hurry up . . . How’d it go? Meet you in the common room, A hippogriff, Yes, No! No! It looks fine, it’s — flying away. . . . S-sorry? You — you just told me that the — the Dark Lord’s going to rise again . . . that his servant’s going to go back to him. . . . But you just said it! You said the Dark Lord — We’ve got to go, He can’t just sit there on his own, waiting for the executioner! If we only had the Invisibility Cloak. . . . . . . if Snape sees me anywhere near there again, I’m in serious trouble, It’s us, We’re wearing the Invisibility Cloak. Let us in and we can take it off. Hagrid Hagrid, He won’t — stay — put — What’s the matter with him? Lumos! Ron! No! That thing’s big enough to eat him; we haven’t got time — If that dog can get in, we can, He’s friends with that dog, I’ve seen them together. Come on — and keep your wand out — This way, I don’t know. . . . It’s marked on the Marauder’s Map but Fred and George said no one’s ever gotten into it. . . . It goes off the edge of the map, but it looked like it ends up in Hogsmeade. . . . Ghosts didn’t do that, Where’s the dog? What — He’s the dog . . . he’s an Animagus. . . . Why’s that? Didn’t care last time, did you? Didn’t mind slaughtering all those Muggles to get at Pettigrew. . . . What’s the matter, gone soft in Azkaban? HE KILLED MY MUM AND DAD! No Argh! NO YOU DON’T! Get out of the way! You killed my parents, The whole story? You sold them to Voldemort. That’s all I need to know. I understand a lot better than you think, You never heard her, did you? My mum . . . trying to stop Voldemort killing me . . . and you did that . . . you did it. . . . Professor, what’s going on — ? I trusted you, and all the time you’ve been his friend! AND HE WAS WRONG! YOU’VE BEEN HELPING HIM ALL THE TIME! If you haven’t been helping him, how did you know he was here? You know how to work it? You wrote — ? How d’you know about the Cloak? What? No, we weren’t! No one was with us! Peter Pettigrew’s dead! He killed him twelve years ago! There were witnesses who saw Pettigrew die, A whole street full of them . . . My dad too? What sort of animal — ? So that’s why Snape doesn’t like you, because he thought you were in on the joke? Professor Lupin could have killed me about a hundred times this year, I’ve been alone with him loads of times, having defense lessons against the dementors. If he was helping Black, why didn’t he just finish me off then? Expelliarmus! I’m still not saying I believe you, And why did he fake his death? Because he knew you were about to kill him like you killed my parents! And now you’ve come to finish him off! Then I should’ve let Snape take you! THAT’S NOT TRUE! HE WAS THEIR SECRET-KEEPER! HE SAID SO BEFORE YOU TURNED UP. HE SAID HE KILLED THEM! The guards say he’s been talking in his sleep . . . always the same words . . . ‘He’s at Hogwarts.’ NO! You can’t kill him, You can’t. I know, We’ll take him up to the castle. We’ll hand him over to the dementors. . . . He can go to Azkaban . . . but don’t kill him. Get off me, I’m not doing this for you. I’m doing it because I don’t reckon my dad would’ve wanted his best friends to become killers — just for you. He can go to Azkaban, If anyone deserves that place, he does. . . . You’re free, Yeah, I knew that, Leave the Dursleys? Are you insane? Of course I want to leave the Dursleys! Have you got a house? When can I move in? Yeah, I mean it! Expelliarmus! “Stay where you are!” “Sirius, he’s gone, Pettigrew transformed!” “I don’t know. . . .” “We’d better get them up to the castle and tell someone,” “Sirius, I need to see the headmaster, WHAT? Minister, listen! Sirius Black’s innocent! Peter Pettigrew faked his own death! We saw him tonight! You can’t let the dementors do that thing to Sirius, he’s — YOU HAVEN’T! YOU’VE GOT THE WRONG MAN! WE’RE NOT CONFUNDED! Professor Dumbledore, Sirius Black — — he escaped when Professor Lupin turned into a werewolf — — Pettigrew’s front paw, I mean, finger, he cut it off — Professor Lupin can tell you — But — But you believe us. Good luck? Three turns? What’s he talking about? What are we supposed to do? “Here —” “What are we doing?” WHAT? WHAT? But — Footsteps across the hall . . . yes, I think it’s us going down to Hagrid’s! Are you telling me, that we’re here in this cupboard and we’re out there too? Where did you get that hourglass thing? There must be something that happened around now he wants us to change, What happened? We were walking down to Hagrid’s three hours ago. . . . Dumbledore just said — just said we could save more than one innocent life. . . . Hermione, we’re going to save Buckbeak! Dumbledore said — he just told us where the window is — the window of Flitwick’s office! Where they’ve got Sirius locked up! We’ve got to fly Buckbeak up to the window and rescue Sirius! Sirius can escape on Buckbeak — they can escape together! Well, we’ve got to try, haven’t we? Doesn’t sound like anyone’s there. . . . Come on, let’s go. . . . We’ll run for it, Straight into the forest, all right? We’ll have to hide behind a tree or something and keep a lookout — Let us in and we can take it off. This is the weirdest thing we’ve ever done, Now? That’s going to give us about sixty seconds, We’d only be seen by ourselves and Hagrid! Okay! Come on! Where are you? Dad, come on — Yes, haven’t you been listening? I saw me but I thought I was my dad! It’s okay! I knew I could do it this time, because I’d already done it. . . . Does that make sense? D’you reckon he’s up there yet? Hermione! The executioner! He’s gone to get the dementors! This is it, Hermione — Whoa! He’s there! “Get on — there’s not much time, Okay, Buckbeak, up! Okay, let’s go. . . . Peeves! In here! Hermione — what’ll happen — if we don’t get back inside — before Dumbledore locks the door? We did it! Sirius has gone, on Buckbeak. . . . Really — they’ll wake everybody up! What do they think they’re doing? You explain, What? What? What? Why? I’m going to see him, I don’t care. I still want to see him. I’ll meet you back here. I just saw Hagrid, And he said you’d resigned. It’s not true, is it? What? The Ministry of Magic don’t think you were helping Sirius, do they? You’re not leaving just because of that! You’re the best Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher we’ve ever had! Don’t go! How d’you know about that? What else could have driven the dementors back? You told me Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs would’ve wanted to lure me out of school . . . you said they’d have thought it was funny. It didn’t make any difference, Pettigrew got away. Professor Dumbledore — yesterday, when I was having my Divination exam, Professor Trelawney went very — very strange. Yes . . . her voice went all deep and her eyes rolled and she said . . . she said Voldemort’s servant was going to set out to return to him before midnight. . . . She said the servant would help him come back to power.  “And then she sort of became normal again, and she couldn’t remember anything she’d said. Was it — was she making a real prediction?” But — I stopped Sirius and Professor Lupin from killing Pettigrew! That makes it my fault if Voldemort comes back! I don’t want a bond with Pettigrew! He betrayed my parents! Last night . . . I thought it was my dad who’d conjured my Patronus. I mean, when I saw myself across the lake . . . I thought I was seeing him. It was stupid, thinking it was him, I mean, I knew he was dead. So what? She did put enough stamps on, then, So — can I go then? You’ve seen her, She’s my friend Ron’s mother, she was meeting him off the Hog — off the school train at the end of last term. It’s a sport, Normal for us, you know, owl post. That’s what’s normal for wizards. Only after Dudley finished with them, “Okay, I can’t see the World Cup. Can I go now, then? Only I’ve got a letter to Sirius I want to finish. You know — my godfather.” Well — yeah, It’s been a while since he heard from me, and, you know, if he doesn’t, he might start thinking something’s wrong. Well, all right then. Er, I think so, I know, Maybe — er — the traffic’s bad, or something. They — they’ve tried to get here by Floo powder, Mr. Weasley? Can you hear me? Mr. Weasley, it’s Harry . . . the fireplace has been blocked up. You won’t be able to get through there. They’ve got an electric fire, It’s upstairs, Yep, that’s Dudley. Well . . .’bye then, It doesn’t matter, Honestly, I don’t care. See you, See you, the Burrow! What is it? What was it? Yeah, he is, Mr. Weasley, What is it? Hi, Percy, What are you working on? Er — why are you calling that owl Pig? Where’s Crookshanks? Percy’s enjoying work, then? Yeah, thanks a lot, They saved my life, those cakes. What is this? Wow — hope it does this time! Yeah, very good. You have to pass a test to Apparate? Er — Splinched? Were they okay? But Bill and Charlie and Percy can all do it? Walk? What, are we walking to the World Cup? So how does everyone get there without all the Muggles noticing? What sort of objects are Portkeys? Er — yeah, A twenty, Ah yes, so it is. . . . I don’t know, these little bits of paper . . . Let’s go and have a look, Who d’you reckon they are? They don’t go to Hogwarts, do they? They’re what? Wow, look at these! Three pairs, You won’t be getting anything for Christmas, For about ten years, mind. Dobby? Sorry, I just thought you were someone I knew. Yeah, I am, How is he? How’s freedom suiting him? Why? What’s wrong with him? Why not? Paying? Well — why shouldn’t he be paid? Well, it’s about time he had a bit of fun, Why’s he sent you up here, if he knows you don’t like heights? Dobby was weirder, What are veel — ? Hawkshead Attacking Formation, What? But Levski’s got the Quaffle! They’re going to crash! He’s seen the Snitch! He’s seen it! Look at him go! Lynch is! He’s got it — Krum’s got it — it’s all over! He knew they were never going to catch up! The Irish Chasers were too good. . . . He wanted to end it on his terms, that’s all. . . . Hermione’s a witch, Where’re your parents? Out there wearing masks, are they? Sorry? Oh . . . yeah . . . right, Ah, no, I don’t believe it . . . I’ve lost my wand! Yeah, maybe . . . Bet she didn’t ask permission to hide, Imagine if your dad catches Lucius Malfoy, He’s always said he’d like to get something on him. Hello? Who’s there? MORSMORDRE! Who’s there? What happened? Voldemort’s — ? DUCK! We didn’t do that! Hey — that’s mine! That’s my wand! I dropped it! I didn’t drop it there, anyway, I missed it right after we got into the wood. No, It definitely didn’t sound like an elf. What? What are Death Eaters? Mrs. Weasley, Hedwig hasn’t arrived with a letter for me, has she? All right if I go and dump my stuff in your room, Ron? There’s something I haven’t told you, On Saturday morning, I woke up with my scar hurting again. I’m sure he wasn’t on Privet Drive, But I was dreaming about him . . . him and Peter — you know, Wormtail.   I can’t remember all of it now, but they were plotting to kill . . . someone. Yeah, but was it, though? It’s weird, isn’t it? . . . My scar hurts, and three days later the Death Eaters are on the march, and Voldemort’s sign’s up in the sky again. And remember what Professor Trelawney said? At the end of last year? You weren’t there, You didn’t hear her. This time was different. I told you, she went into a trance — a real one.   she said the Dark Lord would rise again . . . greater and more terrible than ever before . . . and he’d manage it because his servant was going to go back to him . . . and that night Wormtail escaped. I told Sirius about my scar, I’m waiting for his answer. I hoped he’d get back to me quickly, Yeah, I know, Yeah, I want to play Quidditch, Hang on, I’ll get my Firebolt. Ron, Ron, you don’t reckon Sirius has been caught, do you? Yeah, I suppose. . . . Who is Mad-Eye? Yeah, thanks for everything, Mrs. Weasley, Durmstrang’s another Wizarding school? Er — why not? Er . . . if you say so, Don’t remember asking you to join us, Malfoy, Hi, Hagrid! Says who? Hope they hurry up with the Sorting. I’m starving. Hi, Colin, Er — good, Er — yeah, all right, Brothers and sisters usually go in the same Houses, don’t they? That’s not the song it sang when it Sorted us, Why? Wha’ ’appened? Why? Moody? Mad-Eye Moody? The one your dad went to help this morning? Who’s this impartial judge who’s going to decide who the champions are? “S’pose not. . . .” Double Divination this afternoon, What? Born under — what, sorry? No, I was born in July. I’ve got two Neptunes here, that can’t be right, can it? Get stuffed, Malfoy, C’mon, Ron. . . . You know your mother, Malfoy? that expression she’s got, like she’s got dung under her nose? Has she always looked like that, or was it just because you were with her? Keep your fat mouth shut, then, No, missed. The what? Don’t tell me you’re going back to the library this evening? But you told us Professor Vector — What was it like? Doing what? Yeah, Moody. I reckon Snape’s a bit scared of him, you know, Library. C’mon, quick, or we won’t get decent seats. Yes, Wouldn’t Moody and Dumbledore be in trouble with the Ministry if they knew we’d seen the curses? Shall we get our Divination stuff, then? Neville? I haven’t got a clue what this lot’s supposed to mean, What — make it up? Right, Okay . . . on Monday, I will be in danger of — er — burns. Lose a treasured possession, Yeah . . . cool . . . because . . . Venus is in the twelfth house. And on Wednesday, I think I’ll come off worst in a fight. Yeah, you’ll be betting I’ll win my fight. . . . Hedwig! About time! I shouldn’t’ve told him! It’s made him think he’s got to come back! Coming back, because he thinks I’m in trouble! And there’s nothing wrong with me! And I haven’t got anything for you, you’ll have to go up to the Owlery if you want food. I’m going to bed, See you in the morning. So what? He’s not going back to Azkaban because of me. The way he talks, you’d think we were all going to be attacked any second. Brilliant! It’s Potions last thing on Friday! Snape won’t have time to poison us all! Diggory, He must be entering the tournament. TRIWIZARD TOURNAMENT Thought any more about trying to enter? Who are the judges? Thanks, Hedwig, How, then? Broomsticks? Well, if they’re any bigger than this lot, even Hagrid won’t be able to handle them, That’s if he hasn’t been attacked by his skrewts. Wonder what’s up with them? Nope, they’re upstairs in my bag, The what? Me, I would’ve if it had been me . . . wouldn’t have wanted everyone watching. What if the goblet just gobbed you right back out again? We haven’t been down to visit Hagrid yet, Hey, Ron, It’s your friend . . . Dunno, Hang around, I suppose. . . . Madame Maxime’s staying to judge, isn’t she? Go on, Hagrid! And what’s with the hair and the suit? It’s her, Ron! You know I didn’t. You know I didn’t. I s’pose, Ah . . . okay, Balderdash, I didn’t, I’m not hungry, I had enough at the feast — I didn’t, I don’t know how it happened. I’m tired! No, seriously, George — I’m going to bed — Good idea, Have you seen Ron? Does he still think I entered myself? What’s that supposed to mean, ‘not really’? Jealous? Jealous of what? He wants to make a prat of himself in front of the whole school, does he? Great, Tell him from me he’s welcome to it. . . . People gawping at my forehead everywhere I go. . . . Yeah, give Ron a good kick up the — Come off it, He came back to the country just because my scar twinged. He’ll probably come bursting right into the castle if I tell him someone’s entered me in the Triwizard Tournament — How? Okay, okay, I’ll write to him, Whose owl am I going to use? He told me not to use Hedwig again. I’m not asking Ron for anything, Wonder why that was, Still — never mind, eh? Double Potions to look forward to this afternoon. . . . Furnunculus! We attacked each other at the same time! Yeah, really amazing, What do they want photos for, Colin? Great, Exactly what I need. More publicity. Wand weighing? Er — A what? Er — I didn’t, I don’t know how my name got into the Goblet of Fire. I didn’t put it in there. But I didn’t enter, I haven’t really thought . . . yeah, nervous, I suppose, Well . . . they say it’s going to be a lot safer this year, Er, I didn’t enter, No, I have NOT got tears in my eyes! Oh — right, Yeah, that’s right! I’ve just been crying my eyes out over my dead mum, and I’m just off to do a bit more. . . . Oh — right — sorry, I didn’t start this, It’s his problem. Miss him? I don’t miss him. . . . Wronski Feint,” What about Ron, though? Don’t you want to go with him? No, I’ll come, but I’m not meeting Ron, and I’m wearing my Invisibility Cloak. Yeah, right, Hermione, when are you going to give up on this spew stuff? No idea, ask Fred and George, Can your eye — I mean, can you — ? Why does Hagrid want me to meet him at midnight? Thanks! Yeah, What’s up? What’re you showing me? ... I Hagrid, what — ? Balderdash! Sirius — how’re you doing? I’m — . . . and now Hagrid’s just shown me what’s coming in the first task, and it’s dragons, Sirius, and I’m a goner, What? Yes — he — what? Karkaroff got released? Why did they release him? Okay, But . . . are you saying Karkaroff put my name in the goblet? Because if he did, he’s a really good actor. He seemed furious about it. He wanted to stop me from competing. — you and the rest of the world, What? Karkaroff’s trying to kill me? But — why? Yeah, So . . . so Voldemort could have found out about the tournament? Is that what you mean? You think Karkaroff might be here on his orders? Looks like a really good plan from where I’m standing, They’ll just have to stand back and let the dragons do their stuff. Yeah, Go! Go! There’s someone coming! What’s that got to do with you? What are you doing down here at this time of night? Does he? There you go, Something for you to wear on Tuesday. You might even have a scar now, if you’re lucky. . . . That’s what you want, isn’t it? Let’s try some simple spellbooks, then, Hermione, will you shut up for a bit, please? I’m trying to concentrate. Hermione, Go on, I’ll catch you up. I’ll catch you up, okay? Diffindo! Cedric, the first task is dragons. Dragons, They’ve got four, one for each of us, and we’ve got to get past them. Dead sure, I’ve seen them. Never mind, But I’m not the only one who knows. Fleur and Krum will know by now — Maxime and Karkaroff both saw the dragons too. It’s just . . . fair, isn’t it? We all know now . . . we’re on an even footing, aren’t we? Er — Professor, I’m supposed to be in Herbology — Hermione, Hermione — I need you to help me. Hermione, What d’you think I’m trying to do? A great big dragon keeps popping up in my head for some reason. . . . Okay, try again. . . . Well, that’s good, just as long as it’s not drawn-out. I don’t want to suffer. Well, now we know what to do next time I can’t manage a spell, threaten me with a dragon. Right . . . Accio Dictionary! Just as long as it works tomorrow, The Firebolt’s going to be much farther away than the stuff in here, it’s going to be in the castle, and I’m going to be out there on the grounds. . . . Okay, Yeah, Yes, Yes, I’m fine. Thanks, Er . . . yes, What? I — no, nothing. Thanks, no — I — I know what I’m going to do, thanks. No, I’m fine, I’ve got a plan worked out, I — Accio Firebolt! Okay, diversionary tactics . . . let’s go. . . . Come on, come on, come and get me . . . up you get now . . . Thanks, Hagrid, Caught on, have you? Took you long enough. It’s all right, Forget it. Forget it, Forget it. Forget it, There’s nothing to cry about! Ten? But . . . I got hurt. . . . What’s he playing at? And you, Yeah, you can have a word, Good-bye. I was supposed to work out how to get past the dragon on my own too, What?  Oh yeah . . . ouch . . . interesting, Yes, She’ll twist everything he says, It’d be a bit more impressive if she hadn’t done it about eighty times before, But if I’d dropped dead every time she’s told me I’m going to, I’d be a medical miracle. Dunno . . . balderdash. What’s the matter? Okay, Hermione, where are we going? D-Dobby? What? Winky? She’s here too? Hello, Winky, Okay, How long have you been here, Dobby? Can’t house-elves speak their minds about their masters, then? But you can say what you like about the Malfoys now? You just need a bit of practice, Bagman — bad? Thanks a lot! See you, Dobby! ’Course you can, Let’s hope they don’t look too closely at Winky, Doesn’t think much of Bagman, though, does she? Wonder what Crouch says at home about him? She was a foot taller than me, Imagine what I’d look like trying to dance with her. ’Course she did, She can’t keep writing about what a tragic little hero I am, it’ll get boring. She should’ve interviewed Snape, He’d give her the goods on me any day. ‘Potter has been crossing lines ever since he first arrived at this school. . . .’ Cheers, Hagrid, No one, yet, It’s Christmas, Hermione, Like what? Come on, Hermione, I’ve got till February the twenty-fourth, I suppose there’s always Moaning Myrtle, All right, then, I’ll meet you at dinner, Er — Cho? Could I have a word with you? Er, Wangoballwime? D’you — d’you want to go to the ball with me? Oh, Oh okay, no problem. That’s okay, no problem. That’s okay, Yeah, Who’re you going with? All right, then, Fairy lights, What’s up, Ron? Like what? You what? She’s part veela, You were right — her grandmother was one. It wasn’t your fault, I bet you just walked past when she was turning on the old charm for Diggory and got a blast of it — but she was wasting her time. He’s going with Cho Chang. I asked her to go with me just now, and she told me. Like what? Wait here, Parvati? Will you go to the ball with me? Thanks, Lavender — will you go with Ron? Can’t you think of anyone who’d go with Ron? She’s going with someone else. No idea, So what about Ron? Yeah, that would be great, Let me know, will you? Yeah, okay, Come on, how’m I supposed to concentrate with all this noise going on? I won’t even be able to hear the egg over this lot. Dobby! Don’t do that! It’s okay, Just — just prod me or something in future, all right, don’t bend over me like that. . . . No, it’s just Dobby, Go back to sleep. ’Course you can, Er . . . I’ve got something for you too. Sorry, I forgot to wrap them. . . . They’re . . . they’re really . . . well, thanks, Dobby, You — er — look nice, Right, Why didn’t he come? Oh — yeah, Dobby the house-elf knitted them for me, Let’s sit down, shall we? No, I don’t like it, How’s it going? What? Hi, Hermione And since when have he and Snape been on first-name terms? So? What’s the problem with giants? Who cares? There’s nothing wrong with Hagrid! But what’s it matter if his mother was a giantess? What happened to them? I don’t know who Maxime thinks she’s kidding, If Hagrid’s half-giant, she definitely is. Big bones . . . the only thing that’s got bigger bones than her is a dinosaur. Fairy lights! Where’s Hagrid? “What’s wrong with Hagrid?” “I do mind, though,”  What’s up with him?” “What d’you reckon’s wrong with him? You don’t think a skrewt — ?” “What d’you mean?” You -- “What about Hagrid? “Look at this!” “Oh I — I reckon I’ve got a pretty good idea what it’s about now,” “Fine, thanks,” “Thanks,” What do they want? Why are they looking for him here? He’s at the Ministry in London, isn’t he? Er . . . not bad, We’re supposed to work out the clues alone, aren’t we? Have you offered Cedric help? Well, thanks, He offered to help me with the golden egg, Er . . . nearly, He’s not, I asked, said Bagman. He’s still ill. Hasn’t been into work. Crouch can speak loads of different languages, though, Maybe they need an interpreter. Hi, Hagrid, Of course we still want to know you! You don’t think anything that Skeeter cow — sorry, Professor, Er — right, I just meant — Hagrid, how could you think we’d care what that — woman — wrote about you? Hagrid, look what I’ve got for relatives! Look at the Dursleys! ’Lo, Really great. banana fritters “Pine fresh,” Myrtle! I’m — I’m not wearing anything! Yeah . . . well . . . I’m not supposed to come into your bathroom, am I? It’s a girls’ one. I got told off for going in there, I thought I’d better not come back after that. Have you been spying on him too? I’m honored, You keep your eyes shut! Yeah . . . ‘Come seek us where our voices sound . . .’ and if I need persuading . . . hang on, I need to listen again. . . . I’ve got to go and look for people who can’t use their voices above the ground. . . . Er . . . who could that be? Underwater . . . Myrtle . . . what lives in the lake, apart from the giant squid? Well, does anything in there have a human voice? Hang on — Myrtle, there aren’t merpeople in there, are there? That’s it, isn’t it? The second task’s to go and find the merpeople in the lake and . . . and . . . Myrtle, how am I supposed to breathe? What’s tactless? Sorry, I didn’t mean — I just forgot . . . We’ve taken what you’ll sorely miss, Good, Well, I’m a lot further on than I was. . . . Shut your eyes again, will you? I’m getting out. Er . . . I’ll try, See you, Myrtle . . . thanks for your help. It’s mine! Mine! Yeah . . . I — er . . . thanks, Map of Hogwarts, Yeah, it’s . . . quite useful, Er — Professor Moody, d’you think you could help me — ? Er . . . yeah, I did . . . It was Mr. Crouch. Positive, Er . . . Professor Moody . . . why d’you reckon Mr. Crouch wanted to look around Snape’s office? Professor Moody? D’you think . . . could this have anything to do with . . . maybe Mr. Crouch thinks there’s something going on. . . . I don’t know, odd stuff’s been happening lately, hasn’t it? It’s been in the Daily Prophet . . . the Dark Mark at the World Cup, and the Death Eaters and everything. . . . Oh! Yeah, okay. No, Er — no, I’ve been working out the clue. Keep your voice down! I just need to — sort of fine-tune it, all right? Just forget the egg for a minute, all right? I’m trying to tell you about Snape and Moody. . . . Well, I dunno if that’s what Dumbledore asked him to do, but he’s definitely doing it, Moody said Dumbledore only lets Snape stay here because he’s giving him a second chance or something. . . . I just want to know what Snape did with his first chance, if he’s on his second one, Yeah, I don’t fancy walking around with a periscope sticking out of my head, I s’pose I could always attack someone in front of Moody; he might do it for me. . . . Dunno, Come on . . . Care of Magical Creatures. Or a frog, Hermione, I was joking, I know I haven’t got a chance of turning into a frog by tomorrow morning. . . . Right, Lumos, I can’t, Give it to me! That hurts — get off — ouch — Stop poking me — Stop poking me — Stop poking me — Ten minutes? Ten — ten minutes? It’s too late, Dobby, I’m not doing the task, I don’t know how — What? What? What? What? What? They’ve got . . . they’ve got Ron? — ‘the prospect’s black,’ ‘Too late, it’s gone, it won’t come back. ’ Dobby — what’ve I got to do? What’s it do? Dobby, listen — are you sure about this? See you later, Dobby! I’m . . . here . . . Dunno, Relashio! Myrtle! Come ON! No way! She’s my friend too! And I don’t want them to die either! Get out of the way! You’ve got until three! One . . . two . . . Fleur didn’t turn up, I couldn’t leave her, The song said — C’mon, help me with her, I don’t think she can swim very well. She’s fine! Yeah, that’s right, No . . . I found you okay. . . . Yeah, Yeah, I haven’t been anywhere near your office! I don’t know what you’re talking about, Right, I’ll bear that in mind if I ever get the urge to go in there. No, Clearing up my armadillo bile, Professor, What’re you doing here, Sirius? What if they catch you? What if you’re seen? They’re making it sound like he’s dying, But he can’t be that ill if he managed to get up here. . . . Mind you, he did look ill, last time I saw him up close, The night my name came out of the goblet. . . . Yeah, at the Quidditch World Cup, No, I think he said he’d been too busy. No, No, I didn’t need to use it before we got in the forest. And then I put my hand in my pocket, and all that was in there were my Omnioculars. Are you saying whoever conjured the Mark stole my wand in the Top Box? Loads of people, No one, Oh yeah . . . He’s okay, He keeps offering to help me with the Triwizard Tournament. Says he’s taken a liking to me, Went to look in the bushes, but there wasn’t anyone else there. D’you know Crouch, then? You’re kidding! Was his son a Death Eater? He gave his own son to the dementors? So he’s still in Azkaban? He died? Moody says Crouch is obsessed with catching Dark wizards, So you think Snape could be up to something, then? Yep, Karkaroff wanted to talk to Snape, he says Snape’s been avoiding him. Karkaroff looked really worried. He showed Snape something on his arm, but I couldn’t see what it was. Bagman told me they hadn’t, No one’s tried to attack me so far, except a dragon and a couple of grindylows, You saved my life with that gillyweed, Dobby, you really did, We should get some stuff to send up to Snuffles, Well, it’s not strong, that stuff, Hey, Winky, you don’t know what Mr. Crouch might be up to, do you? Because he’s stopped turning up to judge the Triwizard Tournament. Yeah, we haven’t seen him since the first task. The Daily Prophet’s saying he’s ill. What? We’ll explain later, You missed a really good lesson, They’re good, nifflers, aren’t they, Ron? What’s up? Wrong flavor? What gold? Oh . . . I dunno . . . I never noticed it had gone. I was more worried about my wand, wasn’t I? Listen, I had other stuff on my mind that night! We all did, remember? Forget it, all right? It’ll die down, though, if we just ignore it. . . . People got bored with that stuff she wrote about me last time — Maybe she had you bugged, “Don’t you want to see what Percy’s written?” That wouldn’t be too bad, They’re hedges! Yeah, all right, Okay, No, it’s okay, Mr. Bagman, I think I can find the castle on my own, thanks. What’re we going this way for? Nothing, We’re friends. She’s not my girlfriend and she never has been. It’s just that Skeeter woman making things up. Yeah, because we’re friends. No, Thanks, I saw you at the Quidditch World Cup. The Wronski Feint, you really — Mr. Crouch? Mr. Crouch? Are you all right? No idea, Listen, you’d better go and get someone — Okay, if you get up, Mr. Crouch, we can go up to the — I’m a student at the school, No That’s right, I’ll get Dumbledore if you let go of me, Just let go, Mr. Crouch, and I’ll get him. . . . You stay here with him! I’ll get Dumbledore, I’ll be quicker, I know where his office is — Just stay with him, I’ll get Dumbledore if you let me go, Mr. Crouch! Help me, will you? Just keep him here, I’ll be back with Dumbledore. Over here, Viktor? They were here, They were definitely somewhere around here. . . . Should I go and get someone? Madam Pomfrey? Er — yes, Krum’s all right! He wasn’t trying to jinx me, he just wanted to talk about Hermione — You were getting on all right with Madame Maxime, I don’t think so, He seemed really weak — I don’t reckon he was up to Disapparating or anything. I’ve told you, he wasn’t making much sense, He said he wanted to warn Dumbledore about something. He was out of his mind, Half the time he seemed to think his wife and son were still alive, and he kept talking to Percy about work and giving him instructions. I’ve told you, He said he’s getting stronger. He was sanest when he was trying to talk about Voldemort, He was having real trouble stringing two words together, but that was when he seemed to know where he was, and know what he wanted to do. He just kept saying he had to see Dumbledore. If Snape hadn’t held me up,we might’ve got there in time.  The headmaster is busy, Potter . . . what’s this rubbish, Potter? ’ Why couldn’t he have just got out of the way? Not unless he can turn himself into a bat or something, If he had the Marauder’s Map on him, it would’ve been easy, No, If it was something that serious, they’d tell someone. They’d tell Dumbledore. We weren’t talking. Yeah, but blackmail . . . Yes, He’d probably blast us through the door if we wake him at the crack of dawn; he’ll think we’re trying to attack him while he’s asleep. Let’s give it till break. Professor Moody? Did you find him? Did you use the map? Well, he wasn’t invisible, The map shows invisible people. He must’ve left the grounds, then. What? Oh yeah . . . “Who’s he, to lecture me about being out-of-bounds?” After all the stuff he did at school!” Look Nothing, I need to go to the hospital wing, I think, Bad headache. I don’t want to see anything except a headache cure, See you later, Yes, I didn’t see Madame Maxime anywhere, though, and she’d have a job hiding, wouldn’t she? Wait here for me, Harry, he said. Our examination of the grounds will not take long. Hello, Fawkes, Professor, What is it? Er, You mean . . . that stuff’s your thoughts? I’m sorry, Bertha? No, Professor — I was in Divination just now, and — er — I fell asleep. Well, I had a dream, A dream about Lord Voldemort. He was torturing Wormtail . . . you know who Wormtail — Voldemort got a letter from an owl. He said something like, Wormtail’s blunder had been repaired. He said someone was dead. Then he said, Wormtail wouldn’t be fed to the snake — there was a snake beside his chair. He said — he said he’d be feeding me to it, instead. Then he did the Cruciatus Curse on Wormtail — and my scar hurt, Harry said. It woke me up, it hurt so badly. Er — that’s all, No, I — how did you know it woke me up over the summer? Professor? I’m sorry, D’you — d’you know why my scar’s hurting me? But . . . why? So you think . . . that dream . . . did it really happen? No, Just the back of his chair. But — there wouldn’t have been anything to see, would there? I mean, he hasn’t got a body, has he? But . . . but then how could he have held the wand? Professor, do you think he’s getting stronger? Professor? Er . . . could I ask you about . . . that court thing I was in . . . in the Pensieve? You know — you know the trial you found me in? The one with Crouch’s son? Well . . . were they talking about Neville’s parents? So they’re dead? Then Mr. Crouch’s son might not have been involved? Er, Mr. Bagman . . . I see, And . . . er . . . Yes, Professor, Yes, Yeah, but he’s only saying that because Crouch disappeared near the Beauxbatons carriage. “He looks like he’s using a walkie-talkie,” “It’s about me, isn’t it?” “Gone off me a bit, hasn’t she?” “S’pose so, “But the task’s not till tonight!” “She doesn’t expect the Dursleys to turn up, does she?” This is really nice of you, Oh yeah, Yeah, okay, “What?” “What?” Didn’t bother to correct her, though, did he? Still . . . you’ll show him, Ced. Beaten him once before, haven’t you? How’s Percy? Are you going to tell us — ? Because Hermione’s not my girlfriend. I’m okay, Lumos, See you, Point Me, Expecto Patronum! Hang on! You’re a boggart! Riddikulus! Reducto! Fleur? Stupefy! Impedimenta! Stupefy! Stupefy! Stupefy! “Are you all right?” I can’t believe this . . . I thought he was all right, Did you hear Fleur scream earlier? I don’t know, No, I reckon we should send up red sparks. Someone’ll come and collect him . . . otherwise he’ll probably be eaten by a skrewt. What? Oh . . . yeah . . . right . . . So . . . so will you move, please? Okay, Can I hear the riddle? Could I have it again . . . more slowly? All the clues add up to a creature I wouldn’t want to kiss? A person in disguise, who lies . . . er . . . that’d be a — an imposter. No, that’s not my guess! A — a spy? I’ll come back to that . . . could you give me the next clue again, please? ‘The last thing to mend,’ Er . . . no idea . . . ‘middle of middle’ . . . could I have the last bit again? Spy . . . er . . . spy . . . er . . . A creature I wouldn’t want to kiss . . . a spider! . . a spider! Thanks! Point Me! Cedric! On your left! Stupefy! Stupefy! Stupefy! Impedimenta! Stupefy! Impedimenta! Stupefy! Expelliarmus! Stupefy! Stupefy! Stupefy! No  Take it, then, Go on, take it. You’re there. That’s not how it’s supposed to work, The one who reaches the cup first gets the points.That’s you.  I’m telling you, I’m not going to win any races on this leg. Take it, then, Just take it, then we can get out of here. I had help on that too, You helped me with the egg — we’re square. We’re still square, I was the only one who was thick enough to take that song seriously! Just take the cup! Both of us, We’ll take it at the same time. It’s still a Hogwarts victory. We’ll tie for it. Yeah, Yeah . . . we’ve helped each other out, haven’t we? We both got here. Let’s just take it together. On three, right? Where are we? Nope, Is this supposed to be part of the task? Yeah, Someone’s coming, You! I WON’T! Expelliarmus! Yes, I will, NOW! Impedimenta! Accio! He’s back, He’s back. Voldemort. He wanted me to bring him back, He wanted me to bring him back to his parents. . . . Dumbledore said stay, Cup was a Portkey, Took me and Cedric to a graveyard . . . and Voldemort was there . . . Lord Voldemort . . . Killed Cedric . . . they killed Cedric. . . . Made a potion . . . got his body back. . . . And the Death Eaters came . . . and then we dueled. . . . Got away . . . my wand . . . did something funny. . . . I saw my mum and dad . . . they came out of his wand. . . . He took stuff from his father’s grave, and from Wormtail, and me, Blood, Yes, Loads of them . . . There’s a Death Eater at Hogwarts! There’s a Death Eater here — they put my name in the Goblet of Fire, they made sure I got through to the end — Karkaroff? Where is he? Have you got him? Is he locked up? Karkaroff? Karkaroff’s gone? He ran away? But then — he didn’t put my name in the goblet? No, you didn’t, You didn’t do that . . . you can’t have done . . . What You fired . . . What are you talking about . . . ? You didn’t . . . it — it can’t be you. . . . No, You’re mad, you’re mad! Moody, How can it have been Moody? Professor, where are Mr. and Mrs. Diggory? ’Lo, Fawkes, He said my blood would make him stronger than if he’d used someone else’s, He said the protection my — my mother left in me — he’d have it too. My wand’s feather came from Fawkes? He spoke to me, The . . . the ghost Cedric, or whatever he was, spoke. An old man, Yes, Is he okay? Look, I saw Voldemort come back! I saw the Death Eaters! I can give you their names! Macnair! Avery — Nott — Crabbe — Goyle — but — Yeah, Yeah . . . of course I do. I don’t want that gold, You have it. Anyone can have it. I shouldn’t have won it. It should’ve been Cedric’s. I told him to take the Cup with me, You take this, It should’ve been Cedric’s, he got there first, you take it — Yeah, What’s Dumbledore asked you to do, Hagrid? He sent Professor McGonagall to ask you and Madame Maxime to meet him — that night. Is it to do with Voldemort? Have you got a new headmaster yet? He’ll never keep Rita quiet, Not on a story like this. How was she doing it? Did I? How? But you said they didn’t work — There was a beetle on the statue the night we heard Hagrid telling Madame Maxime about his mum! Get out, Who? Who you were blackmailing? Bagman? Yeah, So? How? Oh, Well — I did win, didn’t I? So he can pay you your gold! I didn’t make that noise, Listening to the news, Well, it changes every day, you see, That’s all you know, The owls . . . aren’t bringing me news, Well, that’s news to me, Dudley, shut — I’ll do it. I’ve got an owl, you can borrow her, So, I want to know — Nothing, I didn’t do anything to him, it wasn’t me, it was — If you don’t get out of the way I’m going to jinx you, The madhouse has chucked me out, So I can do whatever I like. You’ve got three seconds. Right, I’ve changed my mind, I’m staying. “Ministry of Magic The second one was from my friend Ron’s dad, he works at the Ministry. Because I did magic. Nothing, Yeah, I did, but I didn’t use — As if you’d never be happy again, It wasn’t me! Two of them. I’ve got to go to a hearing, I suppose so. Right, Dudley and I were in the alleyway between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria Walk, Dudley thought he’d be smart with me, I pulled out my wand but didn’t use it. Then two dementors turned up — Of course they didn’t get his soul, you’d know if they had, You can’t give a dementor the old one-two, Because I used the Patronus — I can’t stop the owls coming, I did the Patronus Charm to get rid of the dementors, It’s the only thing that works against them. Couldn’t tell you, No idea. I don’t know why they were here . . . Yes, Yes. Of course I’m not, He must have sent them, Lord Voldemort, Murdered my parents, yes, He’s back, Him. He came back a month ago. I saw him. Yes, Yes. Yes, Yes. Looks like it, Fine, Okay. Right. Okay. You do that. A stag, F-fine . . . “Yeah, I know,” Er — yeah, No, I wouldn’t mind, They won’t, That’ll just depress them. Where are we? What’s the Order of the — ? But where’s — ? Why? What d’you — ? “Mrs. Weasley, why — ?” “Hedwig!” Oh yeah, Sorry about that, but I wanted answers, you know . . . — swear not to tell me, Yeah, Hermione’s already said. Right, Yeah? Have either of you been attacked by dementors this summer? Didn’t work that well, though, did it? Had to look after myself after all, didn’t I? Well, I’m glad he left, If he hadn’t, I wouldn’t have done magic and Dumbledore would probably have left me at Privet Drive all summer. No, So why’s Dumbledore been so keen to keep me in the dark? Did you — er — bother to ask him at all? He could still’ve kept me informed if he’d wanted to, You’re not telling me he doesn’t know ways to send messages without owls. Maybe he thinks I can’t be trusted, Or that I can’t take care of myself — So how come I have to stay at the Dursleys’ while you two get to join in everything that’s going on here? How come you two are allowed to know everything that’s going on — ? SO YOU HAVEN’T BEEN IN THE MEETINGS, BIG DEAL! YOU’VE STILL BEEN HERE, HAVEN’T YOU? YOU’VE STILL BEEN TOGETHER! ME, I’VE BEEN STUCK AT THE DURSLEYS’ FOR A MONTH! AND I’VE HANDLED MORE THAN YOU TWO’VE EVER MANAGED AND DUMBLEDORE KNOWS IT — WHO SAVED THE SORCERER’S STONE? WHO GOT RID OF RIDDLE? WHO SAVED BOTH YOUR SKINS FROM THE DEMENTORS? WHO HAD TO GET PAST DRAGONS AND SPHINXES AND EVERY OTHER FOUL THING LAST YEAR? WHO SAW HIM COME BACK? WHO HAD TO ESCAPE FROM HIM? ME! BUT WHY SHOULD I KNOW WHAT’S GOING ON? WHY SHOULD ANYONE BOTHER TO TELL ME WHAT’S BEEN HAPPENING? CAN’T’VE WANTED TO THAT MUCH, CAN YOU, OR YOU’D HAVE SENT ME AN OWL, BUT DUMBLEDORE MADE YOU SWEAR — FOUR WEEKS I’VE BEEN STUCK IN PRIVET DRIVE, NICKING PAPERS OUT OF BINS TO TRY AND FIND OUT WHAT’S BEEN GOING ON — I SUPPOSE YOU’VE BEEN HAVING A REAL LAUGH, HAVEN’T YOU, ALL HOLED UP HERE TOGETHER — What is this place anyway? Is anyone going to bother telling me what the Order of the Phoenix — ? Who’s in it? Well? Voldemort! What’s happening? What’s he up to? Where is he? What are we doing to stop him? Extendable — ? Couldn’t have been me, could it? So what have you two been doing, if you’re not allowed in meetings? You said you’d been busy. You two passed your Apparation tests, then? Snape? Is he here? Is Bill here? I thought he was working in Egypt. What d’you mean? Couldn’t Percy do that? Why not? What’s happened? You’re kidding? So how come they promoted him? Why not? But what’s this got to do with Percy? “Bet Percy loved that.” What? But Percy must know Voldemort’s back, He’s not stupid, he must know your mum and dad wouldn’t risk everything without proof — What are you talking about? Yeah, Not cover to cover, If they were going to report anything about Voldemort it would be headline news, wouldn’t it! But I’d have seen — What d’you — ? But she’s not writing for them anymore, is she? What? Yeah I don’t want anyone to worship — I didn’t ask — I didn’t want — Voldemort killed my parents! I got famous because he murdered my family but couldn’t kill me! Who wants to be famous for that? Don’t they think I’d rather it’d never — “Look …” Yeah, I know, Who’s Kreacher? “Your — ?” But what’s a portrait of your mother doing here? Yeah, No, I haven’t seen anyone. No, it’s been lousy, “What?” How come? At least you’ve known what’s been going on, What cleaning? How come he’s in the Order? I did! I asked Ron and Hermione but they said we’re not allowed in the Order, so — What’s wrong with that? I want to know what’s been going on, ’Course I will, What? How come he’s stopped killing people? How? How has that helped? So what’s the Order been doing? How d’you know what his plans are? So what does Dumbledore reckon he’s planning? So you’re trying to stop him getting more followers? How? Why? Why? Why’s he being so stupid? If Dumbledore — Frightened of Dumbledore? But Dumbledore doesn’t want — How can he think that? How can he think Dumbledore would just make it all up — that I’d make it all up? But you’re telling people, aren’t you? You’re letting people know he’s back? But if none of you’s putting the news out that Voldemort’s back — What d’you mean? But if Voldemort’s trying to recruit more Death Eaters, it’s bound to get out that he’s come back, isn’t it? What’s he after apart from followers? When he was powerful before? Like what kind of weapon? Something worse than the Avada Kedavra — ? What’re you doing that for? Well, they didn’t tell us much we couldn’t have guessed, did they? I mean, all they’ve really said is that the Order’s trying to stop people joining Vol — — demort , When are you going to start using his name? Sirius and Lupin do. The weapon Sirius mentioned? What d’you reckon it is? He’s got the Cruciatus Curse for causing pain, He doesn’t need anything more efficient than that. What d’you mean? What are Skiving Snackboxes? Testers? Joke shop still on, then? Probably looking for a safe place to keep them, Isn’t that what he was doing the night he was supposed to be tailing me? Picking up dodgy cauldrons? You’re not on here! You ran away from home? Where did you go? But . . . why did you . . . ? But he died, You’re kidding! Were — were your parents Death Eaters as well? Was he killed by an Auror? You and Tonks are related? You’re related to the Malfoys! Lestrange . . . You never said she was your — Sorry? I didn’t mean — I was just surprised, that’s all — But if they do expel me, can I come back here and live with you? I’d feel a lot better about the hearing if I knew I didn’t have to go back to the Dursleys, How am I getting there? “When did Dumbledore tell you that?” Yeah, Just — just toast, thanks, Okay, Right, Well . . . see you later then. You don’t normally walk to work, do you? They’re out of order, Mr. Weasley, I think this might be out of order too, Yes, thanks Mr. Weasley, aren’t we underground? A regurgitating toilet? Plumbers? Will it be Aurors who catch them? Why have they changed the time? Sorry, I-I didn’t know the time had changed. Yes. Yes, Yes, Yes, but — Yes, but — Yes, Yes, Yes, but — Yes, but — Yes, Yes, Yes, but — Yes, but — Yes, Yes, Yes, but — Yes, but — Yes, Yes, A — what? Yes, it’s a stag, it’s always a stag. Yes, Yes, Yes, I did it because of the dementors! I mean there were two dementors down that alleyway and they went for me and my cousin! I’m not lying! There were two of them, coming from opposite ends of the alley, everything went dark and cold and my cousin felt them and ran for it — That wasn’t me, it was a house-elf! Cleared, of all charges! I think so, So what will you have to do about the toilet? Yeah, yeah, I’m good at escaping . . . What are you doing here anyway? Why wasn’t he waiting outside Fudge’s office if they’ve got business to do together? What was he doing down here? What private business have they got together anyway? Mr. Weasley, if Fudge is meeting Death Eaters like Malfoy, if he’s seeing them alone, how do we know they haven’t put the Imperius Curse on him? Wait . . . Everyone seems quite relieved, though, considering they all knew I’d get off, Yeah, Scar, But it’s nothing. . . . It happens all the time now . . . I don’t think that’s true, He wouldn’t give me a straight answer when I asked him if I could. So you think he’s touched in the head? Only two new ones, The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 5, by Miranda Goshawk and Defensive Magical Theory, by Wilbert Slinkhard. What d’you mean? Yeah, Yeah, I see what you mean. No, It’s Ron, not me. Ron’s prefect, not me, Well done, Great. Yeah, no problem, Take her! Cool, Listen — Ron — well done, mate. No, Oh — I dunno — Be careful, But Moody could have his eye on you, Yeah, fine, Yeah, Er . . . listen, I’ve just remembered, I haven’t packed my . . . Hello Mrs. Weasley? Mrs. Weasley, just get out of here! Don’t be stupid, Cut it out, Guard? We have to go to King’s Cross with a guard? Why? I thought Voldemort was supposed to be lying low, or are you telling me he’s going to jump out from behind a dustbin to try and do me in? Where’s Tonks? Thanks, Lee, See you! Shall we go and find a compartment, then? Oh, Right. Fine. Fine, Well, I-I might see you later, then. I know you’re not, Right, I know I am, Another Remembrall? Does it — er — do anything? Oh . . . hi, Malfoy, Who’s Hufflepuff? Can I have a look at this? What? Yeah, but you, unlike me, are a git, so get out and leave us alone. Thanks, Where’s Hagrid? Oh, Ginny’s got him, There she is . . . What are those things, d’you reckon? What things? Those horse — I was saying, what are those horse things? The horse things pulling the carriages! I’m talking about — look! At the — there, between the shafts! Harnessed to the coach! It’s right there in front — Can’t . . . can’t you see them? Can’t you see what’s pulling the carriages? I . . . yeah . . . “Yeah,” “Can you?” Oh . . . yeah, “He’s not there.” Of course he hasn’t, Of course he hasn’t, Maybe he’s not back yet. You know — from his mission — the thing he was doing over the summer for Dumbledore. It’s that Umbridge woman! She was at my hearing, she works for Fudge! Dunno . . . Too right it has, And it wants all the Houses to be friends? Fat chance. Did it? Sounded like a load of waffle to me. Was there? See you later, Erm . . Hi, Not bad, You? “What?” But — why? What d’you mean? She believes the Daily Prophet? She thinks I’m a liar and Dumbledore’s an old fool? “I’ll have a go at anyone who calls me a liar,” Does he think he’ll turn into a nutter if he stays in a room with me too long? What are you still getting that for? I’m not bothering . . . load of rubbish. D’you reckon it’s true this year’s going to be really tough? Because of the exams? D’you know what you want to do after Hogwarts? Why? Yeah, it would, An Auror’s worthwhile! Hi, Yeah, it would, So did you . . . er . . . have a good summer? That’s the bell, The Draught of Peace, Yes, I can, ‘Add powdered moonstone, stir three times counterclockwise, allow to simmer for seven minutes, then add two drops of syrup of hellebore. No, No, I forgot the hellebore . . . Yeah, well, since when has Snape ever been fair to me? Oh, shut up, the pair of you, Can’t you give it a rest? You’re always having a go at each other, it’s driving me mad. Good, I’m not — I never said it — You must remember one of them, Probably that you’re going to be eaten by a giant marshmallow or something, And what good’s theory going to be in the real world? So we’re not supposed to be prepared for what’s waiting out there? Oh yeah? Hmm, let’s think . . . maybe Lord Voldemort? Yep, but yeah, he’s returned! It is NOT a lie! I saw him, I fought him! So, according to you, Cedric Diggory dropped dead of his own accord, did he? It was murder, Get out of it, Peeves. I said, leave me ALONE! SHUT UP! I’ve been sent to see you, Is what true? Professor? Yes, Yes. Yes. Yes, Yes. Yes. Yes, Yes. Yes. What? What do you — ? Every evening this week! But, Professor, couldn’t you — ? “But —” But I was telling the truth! No, thanks, No, thanks, Well, we’ve never had great Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers, have we? You know what it’s like, Hagrid told us, nobody wants the job, they say it’s jinxed. Don’t start arguing again, Can’t we just . . . Let’s just do that homework, get it out of the way . . . Fainting Fancies? I’m going to bed too. Where’s Hagrid? Maybe you will if you don’t shut up, Oooooh! If he calls Hagrid a moron one more time . . . Wow, I wonder what it’d be like to have a difficult life? I just wish Hagrid would hurry up and get back, that’s all, And don’t say that Grubbly-Plank woman’s a better teacher! Because she’ll never be as good as Hagrid, Yes, D’you mind not offending the only people who believe me? Er — thanks very much, Ernie, You know what? Less than zero, Better try, though, hadn’t I? I’ll offer to do two more detentions or something, I dunno . . . I hope she doesn’t keep me too long this evening. You realize we’ve got to write three essays, practice Vanishing Spells for McGonagall, work out a countercharm for Flitwick, finish the bowtruckle drawing, and start that stupid dream diary for Trelawney? Come in, Evening, Er, Professor Umbridge? Er — before we start, I-I wanted to ask you a . . . a favor. Well I’m . . . I’m on the Gryffindor Quidditch team. And I was supposed to be at the tryouts for the new Keeper at five o’clock on Friday and I was — was wondering whether I could skip detention that night and do it — do it another night . . . instead . . . How many times? You haven’t given me any ink, Nothing, How come you didn’t do it last night? Lines. Nope, No, I’m in detention! D’you think I’d rather be stuck in a room with that old toad or playing Quidditch? Do I still have to come back tomorrow? “Ron?” What? What are you doing? Come on, you can tell me! What are you hiding here for? What? I’m not laughing, It’s a brilliant idea! It’d be really cool if you got on the team! I’ve never seen you play Keeper, are you good? So you’ve been practicing tonight? I wish I was going to be there, It’s just a cut — it’s nothing — it’s — No, I’m not giving her the satisfaction of knowing she’s got to me. I don’t know how much power McGonagall’s got over her, No, He’s got enough on his mind, What? Oh — brilliant! There. Listen, Hermione, I was just up in Umbridge’s office and she touched my arm . . . Ah, it’s a possibility, isn’t it? She’s evil, Twisted. I’m not bothering him with this. Like you just said, it’s not a big deal. It’s been hurting on and off all summer — it was just a bit worse tonight, that’s all — Ah, that’s the only bit of me Dumbledore cares about, isn’t it, my scar? I think I’ll write and tell Sirius about it, see what he thinks — All right, all right, I won’t tell him, then! I’m going to bed. Tell Ron for me, will you? Does it involve Paracelsus falling on top of the person’s head? Yeah . . . see you. Morning, Erm . . . Quidditch later, Yeah, okay, What’s happened? Lucius Malfoy, I’ll bet anything, He did recognize Sirius on the platform . . . Shh! Hey! Look at this! No, look . . . this little piece here . . . Six months in Azkaban! Just for trying to get through a door! Wait a moment . . . Sturgis was supposed to come and see us off, remember? Yeah, Yeah, Still, this is important too, we’ve got to practice if we want to stay on the Quidditch team . . . Ignore them, We’ll see who’s laughing after we play them . . . He’s just nervous, He was fine when I was practicing with him this morning. What now? It was — No, Well, I suppose he could’ve played better, but it was only the first training session, like you said . . . You know, we probably should try and get more homework done during the week, No, you know she won’t let us. Well, if you want to — er — what is it? Oh yeah — ‘sever ties’ with me, I swear I won’t get violent. Thanks a million, Hermione, Because I’ve just seen Sirius’s head in the fire, You’ve been popping into the fire every hour? I forgot, Yeah, So maybe he was just, I dunno, really angry or something the night I had that detention. So you don’t think it had anything to do with Umbridge touching me when I was in detention with her? She’s foul enough to be one, Does Lupin know her? No, She’s not letting us use magic at all! Trained in combat? What does he think we’re doing here, forming some sort of wizard army? Percy  Only Ron’s brother Percy reckons there will be — So you haven’t had any news about Hagrid, either? Yeah, but we think this time they have, I would, I just don’t want you chucked back in Azkaban! Look — UMBRIDGE ‘High Inquisitor’? What does that mean? She’s been a WHAT? I know it is, What? Think of a dream, quick, in case the old toad comes our way. Oh, I dunno . . . Let’s say I dreamed I was . . . drowning Snape in my cauldron. Yeah, that’ll do . . . It doesn’t matter, pick any of them, I dunno, last night, whenever you like, What for? Yeah, Quirrell was a great teacher, there was just that minor drawback of him having Lord Voldemort sticking out of the back of his head. Professor Umbridge. Yes, But — what? Professor, no! I’m already being punished by her, why do you have to take points as well? She’s taken points off Gryffindor because I’m having my hand sliced open every night! How is that fair, how? You think McGonagall was right, do you? How she can lecture me about not losing my temper with Umbridge! You do not usually take this class, is that correct? Only because he was too stupid to listen to what Hagrid told him to do, Thanks, No, Yeah, she probably would, And how long d’you reckon it’d take Umbridge to pass another Decree saying anyone who complains about the High Inquisitor gets sacked immediately? Do what ourselves? If you’re talking about Lupin . . . Who, then? What? What’s an idea? I — but — but . . . wait! But I’m not a teacher, I can’t — Me? No I’m not, you’ve beaten me in every test — How d’you mean? But that was luck, Yeah, but if Fawkes hadn’t turned up I — You know that was a fluke, if the Time-Turner hadn’t — Listen to me! Just listen to me, all right? It sounds great when you say it like that, but all that stuff was luck — I didn’t know what I was doing half the time, I didn’t plan any of it, I just did whatever I could think of, and I nearly always had help — That was me, I know what went on, all right? And I didn’t get through any of that because I was brilliant at Defense Against the Dark Arts, I got through it all because — because help came at the right time, or because I guessed right — but I just blundered through it all, I didn’t have a clue what I was doing — STOP LAUGHING! That was me, You — neither of you — you’ve never had to face him, have you? You think it’s just memorizing a bunch of spells and throwing them at him, like you’re in class or something? The whole time you know there’s nothing between you and dying except your own — your own brain or guts or whatever — like you can think straight when you know you’re about a second from being murdered, or tortured, or watching your friends die — they’ve never taught us that in their classes, what it’s like to deal with things like that — and you two sit there acting like I’m a clever little boy to be standing here, alive, like Diggory was stupid, like he messed up — you just don’t get it, that could just as easily have been me, it would have been if Voldemort hadn’t needed me — “Reparo, ’Course I have, Can’t forget it, can we, with that hag teaching us — Well, yeah, I — I’ve thought about it a bit. I dunno, You did listen to what I said about a load of it being luck, didn’t you? Just you and Ron, yeah? Yeah, but I doubt anyone except you two would want to be taught by me. I’m a nutter, remember? Right, I suppose he was checking for the smell of Dungbombs, I forgot to tell you . . . I dunno, Maybe Malfoy, he’d think it was a laugh. Where are we going anyway? The Three Broomsticks? I don’t know about this, Hermione, Has it occurred to you Umbridge might be under that? No, especially as it’s not exactly a homework group you’re planning, is it? I’ll get them, So who did you say is supposed to be meeting us? A couple of people? A couple of people? Yeah? What are they expecting? It’s okay, Hermione, What makes me say You-Know-Who’s back? If you’ve come to hear exactly what it looks like when Voldemort murders someone I can’t help you, So if that’s what you’re here for, you might as well clear out. Yeah, Er — you don’t know Madam Bones, do you? Yes, She’s not wrong, Er — yeah, I did, yeah, Look, I . . . I don’t want to sound like I’m trying to be modest or anything, but . . . I had a lot of help with all that stuff . . . Yeah, well — No, no, okay, I know I did bits of it without help, but the point I’m trying to make is — What? I can’t see Madam Pince being too chuffed with us doing jinxes in the library, You just said this group was the most important thing you’d do this year, This isn’t a coincidence, She knows. There were people listening in that pub. And let’s face it, we don’t know how many of the people who turned up we can trust. . . . Any of them could have run off and told Umbridge . . . I wonder if Hermione’s seen this yet? Er — I don’t think we’re allowed in the girls’ dormitories, We’re going to do it anyway, of course, What? What do you think he was doing? Professor Binns, I’m not feeling well. Not at all well, So I think I’ll need to go to the hospital wing. This is urgent, No, Professor! I’m looking for Professor Grubbly-Plank, It’s my owl, she’s injured. Yes, she turned up after the other post owls and her wing’s all funny, look — Hmm, From London, I think. Er — right — thanks, Oh yeah! Yes, Professor? I — To Grubbly-Plank, And I met McGonagall . . . Listen . . . What? Snuffles, ‘Same time, same place’? Does he mean the fire in the common room? But it was still sealed and everything, And nobody would understand what it meant if they didn’t know where we’d spoken to him before, would they? Neville, no! Help me! I had to stop you, Crabbe and Goyle would’ve torn you apart. Right, Ha, Yes, Maybe I’ll skive off Divination, I’ll pretend to be ill and do Snape’s essay instead, then I won’t have to stay up half the night . . . I think she’s got the results of her inspection back. You and Umbridge have got something in common, She obviously reckons Trelawney’s an old fraud too. . . . Looks like she’s put her on probation. But I kept my temper! I didn’t say anything to her, Angelina, I swear, I — That’s a bright side, is it? No Quidditch practice and extra Potions? Just go and stop them, then! I don’t get why Fred and George only got three O. W.L.s each, They really know their stuff . . . Not that good, The Ministry’s forced through another decree, which means we’re not allowed to have Quidditch teams — How did you know about that? What? What was he doing in the Hog’s Head? I’m still being followed? You do? But — last term all you did was tell me to be careful and not take risks — Hermione, this whole thing was your idea! Well, that’s a bit of a problem now, Dunno where we’re going to be able to go . . . “Sirius?”  “Why did he — ?” “You think Umbridge attacked Hedwig?”  “Accio!” If she’d caught Snuffles . . . He’d probably be back in Azkaban this morning. About Siri . . . Snuffles? But he’s all for it! Let’s get this straight, Sirius agrees with us, so you don’t think we should do it anymore? Yes, I do! He’s always given us great advice! What d’you mean, ‘living through us’? Hermione did it, Impervius! OUCH! Nothing, I — poked myself in the eye, that’s all . . . No, He’s probably miles away. It hurt because . . . he’s . . . angry. He wants something done, and it’s not happening fast enough, I’m not making prophecies, No, It’s more like . . . his mood, I suppose. I’m just getting flashes of what mood he’s in. . . . Dumbledore said something like this was happening last year. . . . He said that when Voldemort was near me, or when he was feeling hatred, I could tell. Well, now I’m feeling it when he’s pleased too . . . I told Sirius last time. Can’t, can I? Umbridge is watching the owls and the fires, remember? I’ve just told you, he already knows, There’s no point telling him again. C’mon . . . we’ve still got Silencing Charms to practice . . . He’s got other plans . . . plans he can put into operation very quietly indeed . . . stuff he can only get by stealth . . . like a weapon.  Something he didn’t have last time. Whozair? Dobby? Thanks, Dobby! Er . . . have you been taking all the clothes Hermione’s been leaving out? Yeah, how is Winky? Not really bad, I’ve had worse. You can’t help me, Dobby, but thanks for the offer . . . Wait a moment — there is something you can do for me, Dobby, No, Professor Umbridge. What! How many people know about it? It sounds brilliant, It sounds perfect, Dobby. When can you show me where it is? Not tonight, Dobby, This is really important. . . . I don’t want to blow it, it’ll need proper planning. . . . Listen, can you just tell me exactly where this Room of Requirement is and how to get in there? Good, because we’ve found somewhere to have our first Defense meeting. Tonight, eight o’clock, seventh floor opposite that tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy being clubbed by those trolls. Can you tell Katie and Alicia? What? This room isn’t just some mad idea of Dobby’s; Dumbledore knows about it too, he mentioned it to me at the Yule Ball. Just in passing, Hold it, I solemnly swear that I am up to no good. Filch is on the second floor, and Mrs. Norris is on the fourth. In her office, Okay, let’s go. Okay, Dobby said to walk past this bit of wall three times, concentrating hard on what we need. Well, This is the place we’ve found for practices, and you’ve — er — obviously found it okay — Dark Detectors, Basically they all show when Dark wizards or enemies are around, but you don’t want to rely on them too much, they can be fooled . . . Well, I’ve been thinking about the sort of stuff we ought to do first and — er — What, Hermione? Er — right, thanks, And — what, Hermione? I’ve used it against him, It saved my life last June. But if you think it’s beneath you, you can leave, Okay, I reckon we should all divide into pairs and practice. Okay, Right — on the count of three, then — one, two, three — Good one! Neville, can you take it in turns to practice with Ron and Hermione for a couple of minutes so I can walk around and see how the rest are doing? Okay, stop! Stop! STOP! That wasn’t bad, but there’s definite room for improvement. Let’s try again . . . No, Well, no, it was lousy, but I know you can do it properly, I was watching from over there . . . What about your parents? Don’t ask, Okay, but we’ve overrun, we’d better leave it here. Same time, same place next week? Okay, and we can decide on additional meetings then. . . . Come on, we’d better get going . . . You know what these remind me of? The Death Eaters’ scars. Voldemort touches one of them, and all their scars burn, and they know they’ve got to join him. Yeah . . . I prefer your way, I suppose the only danger with these is that we might accidentally spend them. Warrington’s aim’s so pathetic I’d be more worried if he was aiming for the person next to me, Don’t be thick, You’re going to be fine. It’s normal to be nervous. Get a grip, Look at that save you made with your foot the other day, even Fred and George said it was brilliant — Oh, a few more accidents like that and the game’s in the bag, isn’t it? He’s just nervous, We’ll be there in a bit, Ron’s just got to have some breakfast. We do, Crabbe and Goyle are in the same mold, ’Course I am, Ban us? From playing . . . ever again? What for? Banned. You didn’t make me punch Malfoy, — it’s got nothing to do with that — — it would’ve wound anyone up — Look, drop it, will you! It’s bad enough without you blaming yourself for everything! Join the club, “Oh yeah?” “Hagrid, it’s us!” What happened to you? So are you going to tell us what’s happened to you? So you have been to look for giants? Yeah, I am, they turned up in Little Whinging and attacked my cousin and me, and then the Ministry of Magic expelled me — — and I had to go to a hearing and everything, but tell us about the giants first. Tell us about your summer and I’ll tell you about mine. You knew where you were going? You knew where the giants were? We know about that, Go on! And how many were there? So, you saw them and then what? Give the what gifts? WHAT? You’re kidding! How did you get out of that? Death Eaters? So what happened? Did you ever get near any of the other giants? Or why you’re back so late, Get under here! Hagrid, hide our mugs! Nope, Trelawney’s on probation already . . . What’s he keeping in there? Did he say? Why doesn’t Hagrid call again? Do you? It’s okay, don’t worry . . . No, it was Dobby the house-elf. Replaced me? Who? And what about the Beaters? Okay, I thought this evening we should just go over the things we’ve done so far, because it’s the last meeting before the holidays and there’s no point starting anything new right before a three-week break — We can practice in pairs, We’ll start with the Impediment Jinx, just for ten minutes, then we can get out the cushions and try Stunning again. You’re getting really good, When we get back from the holidays we can start doing some of the big stuff — maybe even Patronuses. Wet, Because she was crying, Dunno, Maybe I am. Yeah, who does? No, She was the one who started it, Erm, I sort of — patted her on the back a bit. I’ll have to, won’t I? We’ve got D. A. meetings, Well, . . and he’s an international Quidditch player . . . Bit grouchy, yeah, Well, ’night, ’Night, Your dad, Your dad’s . . . been attacked . . . Your dad! He’s been bitten, it’s serious, there was blood everywhere . . . No! It wasn’t a dream . . . not an ordinary dream. . . . I was there, I saw it. . . . I did it . . . I’m fine! There’s nothing wrong with me, it’s your dad you’ve got to worry about — we need to find out where he is — he’s bleeding like mad — I was — it was a huge snake . . . It’s Ron’s dad, He’s been attacked by a snake and it’s serious, I saw it happen. I don’t know. . . . I was asleep and then I was there . . . No! It wasn’t a nightmare, I . . . well, I was asleep . . . But it wasn’t an ordinary dream . . . it was real. . . . I saw it happen . . . Ron’s dad — Mr. Weasley — has been attacked by a giant snake. Inside my head, I suppose — I was the snake, I saw it all from the snake’s point of view . . . Yes, But Mr. Weasley could be anywhere! I had a — a kind of — vision . . . Sirius, Can I have a quick word? Er — now? Yes, but he didn’t tell me what it meant. Well, he doesn’t tell me anything anymore . . . Sirius, Sirius, I . . . I think I’m going mad. . . . Back in Dumbledore’s office, just before we took the Portkey . . . for a couple of seconds there I thought I was a snake, I felt like one — my scar really hurt when I was looking at Dumbledore — Sirius, I wanted to attack him — It wasn’t that, It was like something rose up inside me, like there’s a snake inside me — Are they doctors? Not running away, no, It’s not my own neck I’m saving, What is it? What is it? I haven’t moved! So what’s the message? Why? Why does he want me to stay? What else did he say? What’s this? So that’s it, is it? Stay there? That’s all anyone could tell me after I got attacked by those dementors too! Just stay put while the grown-ups sort it out, Harry! We won’t bother telling you anything, though, because your tiny little brain might not be able to cope with it! He is planning something to do with me, then? Fine, go then! And tell Dumbledore thanks for nothing! What are you doing here? I thought you were skiing with your mum and dad. What’s this? Fine, They do, do they? It’s you lot who won’t look at me! Very funny, Yeah? All been talking about me, have you? Well, I’m getting used to it . . . I didn’t want anyone to talk to me, I forgot, I’m sorry, So . . . so do you think I’m being possessed, then? No, That dream I had about your dad and the snake, though — This was different, I was inside that snake. It was like I was the snake. . . . What if Voldemort somehow transported me to London — ? What bedroom? I haven’t seen him since the night we came back here, You were ordering him out of the kitchen. I mean, when you said ‘out,’ maybe he thought you meant, get out of the house? Yes, Dobby did, he left the Malfoys’ to give me warnings three years ago. He had to punish himself afterward, but he still managed it. I fancy a cup of tea too, Fifth floor, Nah, it’s the fourth, Hasn’t changed much, has he? Professor, should you be wandering around the corridors? Shouldn’t you be in a ward? Er . . . yeah, we have, You used to teach us at Hogwarts, remember? Er — thanks, Squash him — squash him, he’s only a pawn, you idiot — sorry, Mrs. Weasley, what did you say? Snape? No! Er, Study what? Why do I have to study Occlu — thing? Yes, Who’s going to be teaching me? Sirius! NO! Sirius, don’t — What is it? Okay, Okay, Yeah, all right, See you, then . . . I’ll let you know when the next one is, but I can’t do it tonight, I’ve got to go to — er — Remedial Potions . . . Forget it, It’s what everyone’s going to think, isn’t it? That I’m really stup — Oh, Hi. Yes, I have, What? Oh no, I haven’t checked the notice board since I got back . . . Right, Right, Well, I suppose you want to — ? I suppose you want to know when the next D. A. meeting is? Right . . . well . . . that’s settled then, Right, Yes . . . sir, And why does Professor Dumbledore think I need it, sir? What’s that? Sir? He can read minds? So he could know what we’re thinking right now? Sir? Well then, why do I have to learn Occlumency? Sir? I don’t like it much, but it’s been useful, hasn’t it? I mean . . . I saw that snake attack Mr. Weasley and if I hadn’t, Professor Dumbledore wouldn’t have been able to save him, would he? Sir? The one with the snake and Mr. Weasley? I saw inside the snake’s head, not his! How come I saw through the snake’s eyes if it’s Voldemort’s thoughts I’m sharing? Professor Dumbledore says his name, I just wanted to know, And Vol — he — realized I was there? How do you know? Is this just Professor Dumbledore guessing, or — ? Yes, sir, but how do you know — ? Sir? What? No, Did you see everything I saw? My Aunt Marge, I’m trying, but you’re not telling me how! …No I — am — making — an — effort, Yeah? Well, I’m finding that hard at the moment, I am not weak, I KNOW! I KNOW! I saw — I remembered, I’ve just realized . . . What? I said, Because, that corridor I’ve just seen — I’ve been dreaming about it for months — I’ve just recognized it — it leads to the Department of Mysteries . . . and I think Voldemort wants something from — Yes, Okay, Yes, Right, Yeah . . . fine . . . I dunno, Listen . . . I’ve just realized something . . . Right, I saw that door when your dad took me down to the courtrooms for my hearing and it’s definitely the same one he was guarding when the snake bit him. What? Has your dad ever mentioned anything about it? Yeah . . . fine . . . I just feel a bit . . . I don’t like Occlumency much . . . I’m going to have to do this tomorrow, I think I’ll go to bed, Black? Not — ? I don’t believe this, Fudge is blaming the breakout on Sirius? What now? How come we didn’t recognize Devil’s Snare . . . ? We’ve seen it before . . . we could’ve stopped this from happening . . . I met Bode, I saw him at the Ministry with your dad . . . Are you okay, Hagrid? If they do, we’re not going to hear about it, are we? Not after Decree . . . What number are we on now? It’s lessons with Snape that are making it worse, I’m getting sick of my scar hurting, and I’m getting bored walking down that corridor every night. I just wish the door would open, I’m sick of standing staring at it — I am working! You try it sometime, Snape trying to get inside your head, it’s not a bundle of laughs, you know! Well . . . I dunno, Cho might be expecting me to spend the whole day with her. We never said what we were going to do. Well . . . all right, but why? Hi, Hi, Well — er — shall we go, then? Yeah, I do. Yeah, You kept blocking me. Nah, it was Puddlemere United, I saw him at the World Cup last year. So . . . where d’you want to go? Yeah, Yeah, it is weird . . . Yeah, all right, Where — ? Er . . . yeah, Aaah . . . Er . . . listen, d’you want to come with me to the Three Broomsticks at lunchtime? I’m meeting Hermione Granger there. Yeah. Well, she asked me to, so I thought I would. D’you want to come with me? She said it wouldn’t matter if you did. There — there wasn’t time for him to say anything.  Erm . . . so .d’you . . . d’you get to see a lot of Quidditch in the holidays? You support the Tornados, right? Look, let’s not talk about Cedric right now. . . . Let’s talk about something else . . . Well — I have talked about it, to Ron and Hermione, but — Cho? It’s not like that! Cho! Women! What did she want to talk about Cedric for anyway? Why does she always want to drag up a subject that makes her act like a human hosepipe? hey, Hagrid! You all righ’? Yeah, I’m fine, Er — are you okay? Well — no — Yeah . . . I s’pose, Hagrid, where are you getting all these injuries? All those! What are you up to? I wasn’t the sole witness, There were a dozen-odd Death Eaters there as well. Want their names? I suppose, Yeah, but people have got to know what Voldemort’s capable of, haven’t they? Er . . . well, it was . . . a complete fiasco . . . so then, she jumps up, right, and says ‘I’ll see you around, Harry,’ and runs out of the place! what was all that about? What was going on? Me, tactless? One minute we were getting on fine, next minute she was telling me that Roger Davies asked her out, and how she used to go and snog Cedric in that stupid tea shop — how was I supposed to feel about that? That’s right, but — you told me to meet you at twelve and to bring her along, how was I supposed to do that without telling her — ? But I don’t think you’re ugly, Is that what she was doing? Well, wouldn’t it have been easier if she’d just asked me whether I liked her better than you? Well, they should! Then I could’ve just told her I fancy her, and she wouldn’t have had to get herself all worked up again about Cedric dying! Yeah, Hermione, you’re good on feelings and stuff, but you just don’t understand about Quidditch. Good catch, Ginny, I’ve got a lifelong ban. Who’re you after? Help yourself, This one looks okay, though, Hey, she says she believes me! People have written to me because I gave an interview, about what happened to me last June. I mean a reporter asked me questions and I answered them, Last Hogsmeade weekend, What exactly are you so happy about? I have been badly advised, it seems, I do not blame you, Rookwood, You are sure of your facts, Rookwood? Avery told me Bode would be able to remove it. Stand up, Rookwood, You have done well to tell me this, Very well . . . I have wasted months on fruitless schemes, it seems. . . . But no matter . . . We begin again, from now. You have Lord Voldemort’s gratitude, Rookwood . . . I shall need your help. I shall need all the information you can give me. Very well . . . you may go. Send Avery to me. NOOOOOOOOO! No, But Rookwood’s going to help him now. . . . He’s on the right track again . . . I was You-Know-Who, He was with Rookwood, he’s one of the Death Eaters who escaped from Azkaban, remember? Rookwood’s just told him Bode couldn’t have done it . . . Remove something. . . . He said Bode would have known he couldn’t have done it. . . . Bode was under the Imperius Curse. . . . I think he said Malfoy’s dad put it on him . . . The weapon, I know. Yeah, I haven’t got to tell anyone, I wouldn’t have seen it at all if I could do Occlumency. I’m supposed to have learned to shut this stuff out. That’s what they want. He was even hanging around that day I had my hearing, In the — hang on . . . He was in the Department of Mysteries corridor that day! Your dad said he was probably trying to sneak down and find out what happened in my hearing, but what if — Yes, it was, Rookwood used to work there. . . . Maybe Voldemort’ll send Rookwood to do it? “What? I know I am, I don’t know, You mean the one where my cousin tried to make me stand in the toilet? It’s . . . nothing, it was — just a dream I had. I know. So I can learn Occlumency, Just that one, No, they don’t, No — that’s your job, isn’t it? Protego! I . . . dunno what happened, I’ve never seen that before. I mean, I told you, I’ve dreamed about the door . . . but it’s never opened before . . . Can you tell me something, sir? How is she? What the — ? Er — hi, Er — good to see you . . . Yes, His attempt is not working? But — what’s Hagrid attempting to do? Hagrid, what’re you up to? Because you’ve got to be careful, Umbridge has already sacked Trelawney and if you ask me, she’s on a roll. If you’re doing anything you shouldn’t be — They’re not supposed to be pretty, they’re supposed to protect you, What we really need is a boggart or something; that’s how I learned, I had to conjure a Patronus while the boggart was pretending to be a dementor — You’ve got to think of something happy, Hi, Dobby! What are you — what’s wrong? What’s happened, Dobby? Who’s ‘she,’ Dobby? Umbridge? What about her? Dobby — she hasn’t found out about this — about us — about the D. A.? Is she coming? WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? RUN! Dobby — this is an order — get back down to the kitchen with the other elves, and if she asks you whether you warned me, lie and say no! And I forbid you to hurt yourself! Yeh — no. No, No, I don’t, No, No, I don’t, School rules? No. Not that I’m aware of, Yes, it is, NO! No — Professor Dumbledore! Professor Dumbledore . . . Malfoy just docked us all about fifty points, I didn’t do it, Things are changing around here, Potter. I’ve noticed, what? What? Nothing, thank you, Fine . . . tea then, No, No idea, I don’t know where he is. I don’t know, No idea, Haven’t got a clue. Impressive, Very impressive . . . You’ll put Dr. Filibuster out of business, no problem . . . Over here, Are you okay? Umbridge hasn’t been asking you about the D. A., has she? Yeah, well, A lovely person who made a mistake? She sold us all out, including you! Ron’s dad works for the Ministry too! And in case you hadn’t noticed, he hasn’t got ‘sneak’ written across his face — I think it was a brilliant idea, Don’t start crying again, Good, I’ve got enough to cope with at the moment. Yes, N-no . . . I — didn’t — No, No, of course I w — I’ve told you, Snape reckons I can carry on by myself now I’ve got the basics . . . Pretty much, No, Just drop it, Hermione, okay? What? Nothing . . . Wha — oh yeah, we have, That sneak friend of hers, Marietta, Huh? Oh hi, How come you’re not at practice? What? Yeah, I’m fine, It’s not Cho I want to talk to, I . . . I wish I could talk to Sirius, But I know I can’t. Come on, With Umbridge policing the fires and reading all our mail?  Yeah . . . yeah, I thought I’d like — Umbridge’s office, I don’t think so, Sirius’s knife, Christmas before last Sirius gave me a knife that’ll open any lock, So even if she’s bewitched the door so Alohomora won’t work, which I bet she has — Sorry, Professor, I forgot . . . Er, Well, Yes, Defense Against the Dark Arts, I suppose? Yes, What sort of character and aptitude tests do the Ministry do on you, if you get enough N. E.W.T.s? Sirius? Yes, I just wondered — I mean, I just fancied a — a chat with Sirius. No, it’s nothing like that. . . . I just wanted to talk . . . about my dad . . .  Well, but he just attacked Snape for no good reason, just because — well, just because you said you were bored, He kept messing up his hair, Yes, Well . . . I thought he was a bit of an idiot. Yes, he kept looking over at the girls by the lake, hoping they were watching him! She hated him! Even Snape? And my mum was okay with that? Yeah, okay, I just never thought I’d feel sorry for Snape. He told me he’d never teach me Occlumency again, Yeah, he said. Okay, okay, I’ll . . . I’ll try and say something to him. . . . But it won’t be . . . Is that Kreacher coming downstairs?  Anyway, more trouble for Umbridge, isn’t it? He hasn’t, Because they got the gold from me. I gave them my Triwizard winnings last June. Yes, I did, Yeah, I suppose you’d better, ’Specially if she thinks they’re receiving stolen cauldrons or something . . . It’s no good nagging me, it’s done, Fred and George have got the gold — spent a good bit of it too, by the sounds of it — and I can’t get it back from them and I don’t want to. So save your breath, Hermione. I dreamed I was watching you lot play Quidditch, I was trying to get you to stretch out a bit farther to grab the Quaffle. Of course I am, Yeah, I s’pose so, Yeah, that’s right, Yeah, I s’pose so, Yeah, I s’pose so, Er . . . can’t it wait, Hagrid? Till the match is over? ’Course, ’course we’ll come . . . You mean Umbridge? She won’t, she’s got her whole Inquisitorial Squad sitting with her, didn’t you see? She must be expecting trouble at the match. It’ll be Ravenclaw, Hagrid, why are you armed? Firenze said that they’re angry because he went to work for Dumbledore? And you stopped it? By yourself? Hagrid? Where are we going? And was it? Of course we’ll help you, What do you want us to do? What is it? Hagrid, Grawp? Did Madame Maxime want to bring him back? How on earth did you get him back without anyone noticing? What are those ropes for, then? You want us to teach him, Kind of makes you wish we had Norbert back, doesn’t it? We’ll . . . We’ll try, Hagrid . . . Nice try, Good idea, Well . . . see you later, then, Hagrid . . . Calm down, You didn’t mean that, I dunno — Hermione . . . YES! We’ll save our news till tomorrow, shall we? I’m not, I’m just glad we won, that’s all. I suppose she cried, did she? Er — It was Hagrid, He decided to tell us why he’s been covered in injuries ever since he got back from the giants. He wanted us to go into the forest with him, we had no choice, you know how he gets. . . . Anyway . . . Yep, Teach him English, yeah, Why don’t you just do it yourself? Expecto Patronum! We shouldn’t have taken the stupid subject in the first place, Yeah, No more pretending we care what happens when Jupiter and Uranus get too friendly . . . That’s true, Take it for me. . . . Lift it down, now. . . . I cannot touch it . . . but you can . . . “Lord Voldemort is waiting . . .” I’m not going. . . . I don’t need the hospital wing. . . . I don’t want . . . I’m — I’m fine, sir, Really . . . I just fell asleep. . . . Had a nightmare . . . Yes, I mean . . . no . . . I’ve done — done as much as I can, I think . . . I’ll do that, Thanks very much. I need to see Professor McGonagall, Now . . . It’s urgent . . . She’s . . . gone? Yes, Come with me, Come on, I’ve got to tell you something . . . Voldemort’s got Sirius. Saw it. Just now. I dunno how, But I know exactly where. There’s a room in the Department of Mysteries full of shelves covered in these little glass balls, and they’re at the end of row ninety-seven . . . He’s trying to use Sirius to get whatever it is he wants from in there. . . . He’s torturing him. . . . Says he’ll end by killing him . . . How’re we going to get there? Get to the Department of Mysteries, so we can rescue Sirius! What? What? How do I know? The question is how we’re going to get in there! I dunno, Voldemort used an Invisibility Cloak or something! Anyway, the Department of Mysteries has always been completely empty whenever I’ve been — They’re not normal dreams! how come I knew what had happened to him?” Yeah — and that’s why Dumbledore’s been so keen to keep Sirius locked up all the time! What? What? what’s that supposed to mean, a ‘saving-people-thing’? That’s funny, because I definitely remember Ron saying I’d wasted time acting the hero. . . . Is that what you think this is? You reckon I want to act the hero again? Well, spit out what you’ve got to say, because we’re wasting time here! Hermione, it doesn’t matter if he’s done it to get me there or not — they’ve taken McGonagall to St. Mungo’s, there isn’t anyone left from the Order at Hogwarts who we can tell, and if we don’t go, Sirius is dead! You don’t get it! I’m not having nightmares, I’m not just dreaming! What d’you think all the Occlumency was for, why d’you think Dumbledore wanted me prevented from seeing these things? And if I remember rightly, you didn’t have a problem with my saving-people-thing when it was you I was saving from the dementors, or IF YOU THINK I’M JUST GOING TO ACT LIKE I HAVEN’T SEEN — WELL, I EXPECT HE’D SAY SOMETHING DIFFERENT IF HE KNEW WHAT I’D JUST — Never you mind, Well, you can’t, I’ve told you, I saw — How? How’re we going to check? Okay, Okay, if you can think of a way of doing this quickly, I’m with you, otherwise I’m going to the Department of Mysteries right now — He’s not there, Hermione! Right, Five minutes’ll be enough, C’mon, let’s go — Of course now! What did you think, we’re going to wait until after dinner or something? Hermione, Sirius is being tortured right now! Got it, Ready to go, then? Right, So Ron — you go and head Umbridge off. . . . Ginny, Luna, if you can start moving people out of the corridor. . . . Harry and I will get the Cloak on and wait until the coast is clear . . . I’m fine, Here, That’s because it’s colorless, but if you want to walk through it, carry on, then we’ll have your body as proof for the next idiot who didn’t believe us . . . What’s the signal? Number twelve, Grimmauld Place! Sirius? Sirius, are you there? Who’s there? Where’s Sirius, Kreacher? Where’s he gone? Where’s he gone, Kreacher? I’m warning you! What about Lupin? Mad-Eye? Any of them, are any of them here? Where has Sirius gone? Kreacher, has he gone to the Department of Mysteries? But you know! Don’t you? You know where he is! You — ! I was — trying to get my Firebolt! No one — It’s none of your business who I talk to, He’s got Padfoot! He’s got Padfoot at the place where it’s hidden! It was you? You sent the dementors after me? NO! No way! Can we have your wand, then, if we’re going first? Er — are you sure this is the right way? Hermione, keep your voice down, I’m not that fussed, to be honest, Smart plan, Really smart plan. Where do we go from here? By the time we’ve done that, Sirius’ll probably be dead! How did you get away? She got carried away, By a herd of centaurs. That’s right! That’s right! and I’m sure Sirius is still alive, but I can’t see how we’re going to get there to help him. Okay, “You’re too —” Yeah, but — No — of course it wasn’t — Well, it doesn’t matter anyway, Yes! Yeah, Just two. Don’t be stupid, we can’t all go! Look, you three you’re not involved in this, you’re not — Okay, then, Ron and I will take these two and go ahead, and Hermione can stay here with you three and she’ll attract more thestrals — What? You’d better hope it stays invisible, We all ready, then? Okay . . . Ministry of Magic, visitors’ entrance, London, then, Er . . . if you know . . . where to go . . . This is bizarre! Over here, Come on! Whoever’s nearest the receiver, dial six two four four two! Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, Ginny Weasley, Neville Longbottom, Luna Lovegood . . . We’re here to save someone, unless your Ministry can do it first! Fine! Now can we move? Come on, Let’s go, Okay, listen, Maybe . . . maybe a couple of people should stay here as a — as a lookout, and — Someone shut the door, In the dreams I went through the door at the end of the corridor from the lifts into a dark room — that’s this one — and then I went through another door into a room that kind of . . . glitters. We should try a few doors, I’ll know the right way when I see it. C’mon. Dunno, Brains? Let’s get out of here, This isn’t right, we need to try another door — In my dream I went through that dark room into the second one, I think we should go back and try from there. Good thinking, Okay, let’s try this one — Who’s there? Sirius? Okay, What are you saying? What? Someone’s whispering behind there, Is that you, Ron? Can’t anyone else hear it? Sirius, Yeah . . . Let’s go, What d’you reckon that arch was? It’s . . . locked . . . Sirius’s knife! This is it! This way! Keep going! This is it, Yeah, Keep your wands out, he might already be dead. . . . He’s right down at the end, You can’t see properly from here . . . He should be near here, Anywhere here . . . really close . . . Somewhere about . . . here . . . He might be . . . Or maybe . . . What What? What What? What What? What What? My name? Why not? It’s something to do with me, isn’t it? It’s got my name on, Where’s Sirius? I want to know where Sirius is! I want to know where Sirius is! You’ve got him, He’s here. I know he is. Don’t do anything, I know Sirius is here, I know you’ve got him! Go on, then, Yeah, right! I give you this — prophecy, is it? And you’ll just let us skip off home, will you? Protego! You’ll have to smash this if you want to attack any of us, I don’t think your boss will be too pleased if you come back without it, will he? So, what kind of prophecy are we talking about anyway? Nope, not jesting, How come Voldemort wants it? Yeah, Yeah, I’ve got no problem saying Vol — Did you know he’s a half-blood too? Voldemort? Yeah, his mother was a witch but his dad was a Muggle — or has he been telling you lot he’s pureblood? You haven’t told me what’s so special about this prophecy I’m supposed to be handing over, I’m not playing games, What? What about my scar? What? Smash shelves — — when I say go — Did he? So he wanted me to come and get it, did he? Why? Why? So, Someone made a prophecy about Voldemort and me? And he’s made me come and get it for him? Why couldn’t he come and get it himself? So he’s got you doing his dirty work for him, has he? Like he tried to get Sturgis to steal it — and Bode? NOW! RUN! Where — where are the others?” Well, we don’t stand here waiting for them to find us, for a start, Let’s get away from this door . . . Stupefy!  STUPEFY! STUBEFY! STUBE — Thanks, right, let’s get out of — RON? GINNY? LUNA? Come on! Petrificus Totalus! HERMIONE! Like you won’t kill us all the moment I hand it over anyway! Petrificus Totalus! Hermione, Hermione, wake up . . . I dunno . . . She’s alive? Neville, we’re not far from the exit, We’re right next to that circular room. . . . If we can just get you across it and find the right door before any more Death Eaters come, I’ll bet you can get Hermione up the corridor and into the lift. . . . Then you could find someone. . . . Raise the alarm . . . I’ve got to find the others, But Hermione — Wait, you’d better take this . . . He’s never going to notice us, C’mon . . . keep close behind me . . . So which way d’you reck — ? Ron! Ginny — are you all — ? GINNY? What happened? What? We’ve got to get out of here, Luna, can you help Ginny? “Colloportus!” Luna — Neville — help me! “Colloportus!” Ron, get out of the way, get down — RON, NO! Diffindo! Let — let the others go, and I’ll give it to you! Neville — no — go back to Ron — Are you okay? And Ron? STUBEFY, STUPEFY! STUBEFY! Thanks! Protego! Petrificus Totalus! Can you stand? No — get — off — me . . . Neville — catch it! IMPEDIMENTA! Come on! It doesn’t matter! Just try and stand, let’s get out of — I — what? Why? SIRIUS! SIRIUS! Get him, save him, he’s only just gone through! We can still reach him — Where’s the exit? Where’s the way out? I am! I am! I am! I am! Crucio! Stupefy! Well, you’re going to have to kill me, because it’s gone! And he knows! Your dear old mate Voldemort knows it’s gone! He’s not going to be happy with you, is he? The prophecy smashed when I was trying to get Neville up the steps! What do you think Voldemort’ll say about that, then? Nothing there! Nothing to summon! It smashed and nobody heard what it said, tell your boss that — Don’t waste your breath! He can’t hear you from here! Look out! Yes, Yeah, I’m — where’s Voldemort, where — who are all these — what’s — No, you don’t, My greatest strength, is it? You haven’t got a clue. . . . You don’t know . . . I don’t want to talk about how I feel, all right? THEN — I — DON’T — WANT — TO — BE — HUMAN! I DON’T CARE! I’VE HAD ENOUGH, I’VE SEEN ENOUGH, I WANT OUT, I WANT IT TO END, I DON’T CARE ANYMORE — I — DON’T! YOU DON’T KNOW HOW I FEEL! Let me out, Let me out, If you don’t — if you keep me in here — if you don’t let me — Let me out, Do you — do you think I want to — do you think I give a — I DON’T CARE WHAT YOU’VE GOT TO SAY! I don’t want to hear anything you’ve got to say! What are you talking — ? You’ve told me this before, Professor, I know, Yeah, Snape told me, Yes, Yeah, I wondered. But I didn’t, I tried to check he’d really taken Sirius, I went to Umbridge’s office, I spoke to Kreacher in the fire, and he said Sirius wasn’t there, he said he’d gone! He — he sent me on purpose? How? He hasn’t been out of Grimmauld Place for years. How do you know all this? He was laughing? Like what? So . . . when I asked Kreacher if Sirius was there last night . . . And Kreacher told you all this . . . and laughed? And, DON’T TALK ABOUT SIRIUS LIKE THAT! What about Snape? You’re not talking about him, are you? Snape — Snape g-goaded Sirius about staying in the house — he made out Sirius was a coward — Snape stopped giving me Occlumency lessons! He threw me out of his office! Snape made it worse, my scar always hurt worse after lessons with him — How do you know he wasn’t trying to soften me up for Voldemort, make it easier for him to get inside my — But that’s okay, is it? It’s okay for Snape to hate my dad, but it’s not okay for Sirius to hate Kreacher? SO SIRIUS DESERVED WHAT HE GOT, DID HE? Yeah, he did hate it! You made him stay shut up in that house and he hated it, that’s why he wanted to get out last night — People don’t like being locked up! She doesn’t love me, I still don’t — “You sent that Howler. You told her to remember — it was your voice —” Yes,  “But what’s this got to do with …” “I don’t —” “I still don’t understand.” “Who heard it?” “It means — me?” “But then … but then, why was it my name on the prophecy and not Neville’s?” Then — it might not be me?”  “But you said — Neville was born at the end of July too — and his mum and dad —” “So he only heard … ?” “I don’t understand what you’re saying,” The end of the prophecy . . . it was something about . . . ‘neither can live . . . ’ So, so does that mean that . . . that one of us has got to kill the other one . . . in the end? He’s got to, the other centaurs won’t take him back, will they? Er — Hagrid’s, You know, he just got back and I promised I’d go down and see him and tell him how you two are . . . Funny, you’d think I’d have stopped walking around . . . Well, I’m terrified now, I s’pose Lord Voldemort’s just a warm-up act compared to you three — what’s the matter? He’s your dad’s mate, isn’t he? Not scared of him, are you? I thought I just had, Yeah, I expect they will, Still, at least everyone knows what scumbags they are now — I’m trying to decide what curse to use on Malfoy, sir, I’m fine, So, where’ve you been? You — you look better, He didn’t want to go at all! I’ve got to go and visit Ron and Hermione in the hospital wing, Yeah . . . right . . . I won’t be long. . . . Look, you go ahead . . . Sirius. “Sirius Black!” Hey — hey Nick! NICK! Nick, can I ask you something? No — Nick — please, I really need to talk to you. Can we go in here? What? That’s right, isn’t it? You died, but I’m talking to you. . . . You can walk around Hogwarts and everything, can’t you? What d’you mean? Oh, Well, that’s okay then, the person I’m asking about is a wizard. So he can come back, right? who Why? Anyway — it doesn’t matter — Sirius won’t care if it’s unusual, he’ll come back, I know he will! What? Gone on where? Listen — what happens when you die, anyway? Where do you go? Why doesn’t everyone come back? Why isn’t this place full of ghosts? Why — ? You’re dead, aren’t you? Who can answer better than you? Don’t talk to me about that place! How come you’re not at the feast? How come people hide your stuff? That’s no reason for them to take your things, D’you want help finding them? Just didn’t feel like it. Have you . . . I mean, who . . . has anyone you’ve known ever died? I’m sorry, Er — isn’t it? You mean . . . Are you sure you don’t want me to help you look for your stuff? Yeah . . . yeah, you too. Nothing, She’s probably cheerful enough with someone else, Good for you. What? I didn’t expect . . . what are you all doing here? I dunno if that’s a good idea, I don’t mean to be rude — Aren’t — aren’t we leaving, sir? Sir — what happened to your — ? Oh. Right. You can keep using it as headquarters, I don’t care. You can have it, I don’t really want it. Why? I bet there has, No But how are you going to find out if I’m allowed to own it? I don’t care, I don’t want him. Kreacher, shut up! Do I — do I have to keep him with me? Yeah, No, he can stay with Hagrid. I think Buckbeak would prefer that. Erm . . . I’ll just go and — er — finish off,  Bye Bye, I’m fine, But I think I might prefer brooms. . . . No, Well, I’m not complaining, “Professor?” Er — where exactly are we? And what are we doing here? How can I help with that, sir? Professor, why couldn’t we just Apparate directly into your old colleague’s house? — you can’t Apparate anywhere inside the buildings or grounds, Hermione Granger told me. Sir, I saw in the Daily Prophet that Fudge has been sacked. . . . Is he . . . Do you think he’s good? You do, And . . . sir . . . I saw about Madam Bones. Professor, what happened to your — ? Sir — I got a Ministry of Magic leaflet by owl, about security measures we should all take against the Death Eaters. . . . Not really. I didn’t . . . Er . . . right, Well, on that leaflet, it said something about Inferi. What exactly are they? The leaflet wasn’t very clear. Professor? You mean he’s — ? Sorry, It’s just — I didn’t like her either. Yeah, I’ve been told, My mother’s eyes, yeah. Which was your House? One of my best friends is Muggle-born, and she’s the best in our year. Not really, And all these people know where to find you, to send you stuff? You don’t have to join the Order to teach at Hogwarts, Most of the teachers aren’t in it, and none of them has ever been killed — well, unless you count Quirrell, and he got what he deserved seeing as he was working with Voldemort. I reckon the staff are safer than most people while Dumbledore’s headmaster; he’s supposed to be the only one Voldemort ever feared, isn’t he? Bye, I didn’t do anything, Er . . . It’s just hard, to realize he won’t write to me again. But while I was at the Dursleys’ . . . I realized I can’t shut myself away or — or crack up.  Sirius wouldn’t have wanted that, would he? . . . Look at Madam Bones, look at Emmeline Vance. . . . It could be me next, couldn’t it? But if it is, I’ll make sure I take as many Death Eaters with me as I can, and Voldemort too if I can manage it. Private — with you? What will you be teaching me, sir? If I’m having lessons with you, I won’t have to do Occlumency lessons with Snape, will I? Wonderful, Well, that means I won’t see much of Professor Snape from now on, I understand, Hi, Tonks. That’s great! What exactly — ? Is Mr. Weasley still at work? Why, where are they? ’Night, Mr. Weasley, Wuzzgoinon? Never been better, You? About one o’clock this morning. Same as usual, they didn’t talk to me much, but I like it better that way. How’re you, Hermione? What’s the time? Have I missed breakfast? Nothing much, I’ve just been stuck at my aunt and uncle’s, haven’t I? It wasn’t that exciting. He just wanted me to help him persuade this old teacher to come out of retirement. His name’s Horace Slughorn. You did? He looks a bit like a walrus, and he used to be Head of Slytherin, Something wrong, Hermione? Dunno, He can’t be worse than Umbridge, can he? Who are you — ? Oh . . . is she here too? Oh, Wow. Er — congratulations! Don’t you get used to her if she’s staying in the same house? How’s she going to manage that? Fleur’s not stupid, she was good enough to enter the Triwizard Tournament, Yes, I was just saying, Phlegm — I mean, Fleur — How does she work that one out? I didn’t know that could happen, Your mum said the shop’s going well, Said Fred and George have got a real flair for business. And what about Percy? Is he talking to your mum and dad again? But he knows your dad was right all along now about Voldemort being back — He’s going to be giving me private lessons this year, I only just remembered, He told me last night in your broom shed. I don’t know exactly why he’s going to be giving me lessons, but I think it must be because of the prophecy. You know, the one they were trying to steal at the Ministry. The Prophet’s got it right, That glass ball that smashed wasn’t the only record of the prophecy. I heard the whole thing in Dumbledore’s office, he was the one the prophecy was made to, so he could tell me. From what it said, it looks like I’m the one who’s got to finish off Voldemort. . . . At least, it said neither of us could live while the other survives. Hermione! Not as much as I was, When I first heard it, I was . . . but now, it seems as though I always knew I’d have to face him in the end. . . . Hang on, I think Dumbledore said our O. W.L. results would be arriving today! What happens if we fail? And there are three of them, — the ice-cream place in Diagon Alley? He used to give me free ice creams. What’s happened to him? Thanks, Bill, Glad he’s pleased, We didn’t know ‘security’ meant you! Really? Going to get a few Death Eater pals to do us in, are you? Wow . . . look at that . . . he’s not here now! So why not have a go? They might be able to find you a double cell in Azkaban with your loser of a husband! Just about, Did you see the Malfoys? Handy, Get under here, quick, He was going in that direction, C’mon. Quick, or we’ll lose him, / Just hurry! Ouch! Dunno, He wants something mended . . . and he wants to reserve something in there. . . . Could you see what he pointed at when he said ‘that one’? But what about when he said, ‘Don’t forget to keep that one safe’? That sounded to me like Borgin’s got another one of the broken objects, and Malfoy wants both. Yeah, I do, Malfoy’s father’s in Azkaban. Don’t you think Malfoy’d like revenge? That’s my point, I don’t know! But he’s up to something and I think we should take it seriously. His father’s a Death Eater and — He’s a Death Eater, He’s replaced his father as a Death Eater! In Madam Malkin’s. She didn’t touch him, but he yelled and jerked his arm away from her when she went to roll up his sleeve. It was his left arm. He’s been branded with the Dark Mark. He showed Borgin something we couldn’t see, Something that seriously scared Borgin. It was the Mark, I know it — he was showing Borgin who he was dealing with, you saw how seriously Borgin took him! I’ll be careful not to slip in it. Is Tonks going to be there? I can walk, thanks, Oh yeah, I forgot, Mr. Weasley, can I have a quick word? When we were in Diagon Alley How did you — ? Er . . . yeah, all right, we weren’t in the back room. Well, we followed Draco Malfoy. We used my Invisibility Cloak. Because I thought Malfoy was up to something, He’d given his mother the slip and I wanted to know why. He went into Borgin and Burkes, and started bullying the bloke in there, Borgin, to help him fix something. And he said he wanted Borgin to keep something else for him. He made it sound like it was the same kind of thing that needed fixing. Like they were a pair. And . . . He’s been branded with the Dark Mark. We saw Malfoy jump about a mile when Madam Malkin tried to touch his left arm. I think he’s been branded with the Dark Mark. I think he’s replaced his father as a Death Eater. Does anyone really know what You-Know-Who would or wouldn’t do? Mr. Weasley, I’m sorry, but isn’t it worth investigating? If Malfoy wants something fixing, and he needs to threaten Borgin to get it done, it’s probably something Dark or dangerous, isn’t it? I think you missed something, Fancy trying to find a compartment? Right, Neville! Luna, hi, how are you? Quibbler still going strong, then? Let’s find seats, They’re staring at you because you were at the Ministry too, Our little adventure there was all over the Daily Prophet, you must’ve seen it. No point now we’ve got rid of Umbridge, is there? They’re friends of mine, You are cool, None of them was at the Ministry. They didn’t fight with me. Sorry — I — I — what? What did he do when he saw you? Dunno, I don’t think so, An invitation, New teacher, Well, I suppose we’ll have to go, won’t we? No idea, Listen, let’s go under the Invisibility Cloak, then we might get a good look at Malfoy on the way, see what he’s up to. Yeah, he is a bit, How come you ended up in there, Ginny? Better reason for inviting someone than because their mother’s famous, I’ll see you two later, Later! Draco Malfoy, Thanks for . . . well . . . Thanks a lot! Was that a Patronus? How did you find me? But what are you doing here, anyway? Is it just you who’s stationed up here, or — ? Dawlish, that Auror Dumbledore attacked last year? Alohomora! I could climb a wall, Well then, I suppose I’ll just have to sleep out here and wait for morning. I couldn’t change, I didn’t have my — Good night, Thanks for . . . everything. Why, what’s wrong with it? Thanks, How’s my nose looking? I’ll tell you later, Not now, Hermione, Hat say anything interesting? “Dumbledore mentioned Voldemort at all?” Snape said Hagrid was late for the feast —” “Bumped into him,” To know what really happened at the Ministry, His hand was like that when I saw him over the summer, I thought he’d have cured it by now, though . . . or Madam Pomfrey would’ve done. No! I thought he was! Well, there’s one good thing, Snape’ll be gone by the end of the year. That job’s jinxed. No one’s lasted more than a year. . . . Quirrell actually died doing it. . . . Personally, I’m going to keep my fingers crossed for another death. . . . Yeah, well, never mind that, Listen to what he was saying before he found out I was there. . . . How d’you know Voldemort doesn’t need someone at Hogwarts? It wouldn’t be the first — Dumbledore uses that name, Got held up on the train, Why were you late? Really? Exactly, It was, but you told me I had to get an ‘Outstanding’ in my O. W.L., Professor. Yes, Don’t be stupid, you don’t need to try out, I’ve watched you play for five years. . . . Protego! Yes, There’s no need to call me ‘sir,’ Professor. He tried to jinx me, in case you didn’t notice! I had enough of that during those Occlumency lessons! Why doesn’t he use another guinea pig for a change? What’s Dumbledore playing at, anyway, letting him teach Defense? Did you hear him talking about the Dark Arts? He loves them! All that unfixed, indestructible stuff — Like me? I’m not sure yet, I’ll let you know. It’s the password to get past the gargoyle outside his study, Ha! Snape’s not going to be pleased. . . . I won’t be able to do his detention! Sir? I haven’t got a book or scales or anything — nor’s Ron — we didn’t realize we’d be able to do the N. E.W.T., you see — Yes, sir, Can I borrow your silver knife? Add a clockwise stir — Got lucky, I suppose, I s’pose you think I cheated? It’s nothing, It’s not like, you know, Riddle’s diary. It’s just an old textbook someone’s scribbled on. I just tried a few of the tips written in the margins, honestly, Ginny, there’s nothing funny — Hey! Finished? Or d’you want to wait and see if it does a few backflips? Good. Then I’ll have it back, The Half-Blood Prince, he was called, How many girls have been Princes? It’s five to eight, I’d better go, I’ll be late for Dumbledore. Acid Pops, Good evening, sir, Yes, thanks, sir, Er, Right, Yes, sir. You said, at the end of last term, you were going to tell me everything, Sir, But you think you’re right? Sir, does what you’re going to tell me have anything to do with the prophecy? Will it help me . . . survive? Where are we going, sir? Who was Bob Ogden? Shall — shall I, sir? Sir — how did you injure your hand? He’s speaking Parseltongue? What happened to the girl in the cottage? Marvolo? That old man was — ? Sir, so Merope was . . . Sir, does that mean she was . . . Voldemort’s mother? The Muggle Morfin attacked? The man on the horse? And they ended up married? The Imperius Curse? Or a love potion? And Merope? She . . . she died, didn’t she? Wasn’t Voldemort brought up in an orphanage? But she did have his baby. What went wrong? Why did the love potion stop working? Sir, Sir . . . is it important to know all this about Voldemort’s past? And it . . . it’s got something to do with the prophecy? Right, Sir, Sir, Good night. Sir, Sir, You were wearing it when we visited Professor Slughorn that night. Sir, But how come — ? Have you always had it? That would be around the time you injured your hand, then, sir? Sir, Sir, We’ll go down after Quidditch, But trials might take all morning, the number of people who have applied. I dunno why the team’s this popular all of a sudden. Ha! Are you mad? I’m keeping it! Look, I’ve thought it out — Diffindo! I’ll give Slughorn back the new one, he can’t complain, it cost nine Galleons. You didn’t try out last year, did you? Right, Well . . . if you wait over there . . . If there’s anyone else here who’s not from Gryffindor, leave now, please! That’s my final decision and if you don’t get out of the way for the Keepers I’ll hex you, Rubbish, That was the one he nearly missed. No, You’ve had your go. You saved four. Ron saved five. Ron’s Keeper, he won it fair and square. Get out of my way. Well done, How are you? Missing him? But you’re okay here with Hagrid, aren’t you? Don’t worry about it, Hagrid! Open up, we want to talk to you! If you don’t open the door, we’ll blast it open! Yeah, I can! I’m sorry, sir, Since when have you called me ‘Potter’? No, We wanted to see you. What are they, Hagrid? I’m starving, And I’ve got that detention with Snape tonight, I haven’t got much time for dinner. . . . I can’t come, Professor, I’ve got a detention with Professor Snape. He’s got no chance of persuading Snape, This detention’s already been postponed once; Snape did it for Dumbledore, but he won’t do it for anyone else. Anything new? Yeah, mine! I told him at King’s Cross about Malfoy and that thing he was trying to get Borgin to fix! Well, if it’s not at their house, he must have brought whatever it is to Hogwarts with him — What? I wasn’t! Someone’s sent it to him by owl, then, His mother or someone. Can you think of any way Malfoy — ? Listen, it’s not my fault Slughorn invited Hermione and me to his stupid party, neither of us wanted to go, you know! From Professor Slughorn? Right, Thanks a lot, Demelza. Sorry! Sorry, Always jump to the worst conclusion, don’t you? Well . . . yeah, it was, but so what? Why does it matter if it’s handwritten? My dad, My dad used this spell, I — Lupin told me. I don’t see where you get that from, If he’d been a budding Death Eater he wouldn’t have been boasting about being ‘half-blood,’ would he? And they’d love to have me, We’d be best pals if they didn’t keep trying to do me in. Thanks, Ginny . . . It’s Dumbledore’s next lesson! Monday evening! Want to join us in Hogsmeade, Ginny? Oh no, Well, I’ve had Quidditch practice, Professor, I can’t, Professor, I’ve got — er — an appointment with Professor Dumbledore that evening. Let’s go to the Three Broomsticks, It’ll be warm. Mundungus! Are you selling this stuff? You took that from Sirius’s house, That had the Black family crest on it. What? Give it to me! COME BACK, YOU THIEVING — ! He’s nicked Sirius’s stuff! Nicked it! He was nicking Sirius’s stuff! Can’t the Order control Mundungus? Yeah, it’s my stuff! No wonder he wasn’t pleased to see me! Well, I’m going to tell Dumbledore what’s going on, he’s the only one who scares Mundungus. Stay there! I’m going for help! Hagrid! Hagrid, someone’s hurt back there, or cursed, or something — Someone’s been cursed! No, it’s not them, it’s Katie Bell — this way . . . Don’t touch it! I’ve seen that before, It was on display in Borgin and Burkes ages ago. The label said it was cursed. Katie must have touched it. How did Katie get hold of this? We’ll need to show this to Madam Pomfrey, Malfoy knows about this necklace. It was in a case at Borgin and Burkes four years ago, I saw him having a good look at it while I was hiding from him and his dad. This is what he was buying that day when we followed him! He remembered it and he went back for it! She said she came back from the bathroom with it, she didn’t necessarily get it in the bathroom itself — It’s the thing she touched, She rose up in the air, and then began to scream, and collapsed. Professor, can I see Professor Dumbledore, please? Away? I think Draco Malfoy gave Katie that necklace, Professor. No, but . . . No, Professor, he just wanted Borgin to tell him how to mend something, he didn’t have it with him. But that’s not the point, the thing is that he bought something at the same time, and I think it was that necklace — No, Professor, he told Borgin to keep it in the shop for him — Because he didn’t want to touch it, obviously! How do you know, Professor? It could’ve been meant for loads of people, Dumbledore — the Death Eaters would love to get rid of him, he must be one of their top targets. Or Slughorn — Dumbledore reckons Voldemort really wanted him and they can’t be pleased that he’s sided with Dumbledore. Or — Couldn’t have been, or Katie would’ve just turned around in the lane and given it to me, wouldn’t she? I was behind her all the way out of the Three Broomsticks. It would have made much more sense to deliver the parcel outside Hogwarts, what with Filch searching everyone who goes in and out. I wonder why Malfoy told her to take it into the castle? He must have used an accomplice, then, Crabbe or Goyle — or, come to think of it, another Death Eater, he’ll have loads better cronies than Crabbe and Goyle now he’s joined up — But since when has Malfoy been one of the world’s great thinkers? Why him? Why not Madam Pomfrey? Where were you this weekend, sir? You will? Sir, I met Mundungus in Hogsmeade. Professor, did Professor McGonagall tell you what I told her after Katie got hurt? About Draco Malfoy? And do you — ? How do you know she was in London, sir? He only gave her ten Galleons? But she could do magic! She could have got food and everything for herself by magic, couldn’t she? She wouldn’t even stay alive for her son? No, but she had a choice, didn’t she, not like my mother — Where are we going? Nice suit, sir, He believed it much quicker than I did — I mean, when you told him he was a wizard, I didn’t believe Hagrid at first, when he told me. Did you know — then? And he was a Parselmouth, The ring’s gone, But I thought you might have the mouth organ or something. Dunno, But he says it’s all important and it’ll help me survive. So how was Slughorn’s latest party? Reparo, Are you still interested in playing Chaser? Well then, you’re in, There’s a practice tonight, seven o’clock. You — In the air, everyone, let’s go. . . . Good work, everyone, I think we’ll flatten Slytherin, No, you didn’t, You’re the best Keeper I tried out, Ron. Your only problem is nerves. He doesn’t mean anything, Ginny — Don’t be stupid — C’mon, What? Oh . . . er . . . ENOUGH! Peakes, go and pack up the Bludgers. Demelza, pull yourself together, you played really well today. Ron . . . you’re my best mate, but carry on treating the rest of them like this and I’m going to kick you off the team. You’re not pathetic and you’re not resigning! You can save anything when you’re on form, it’s a mental problem you’ve got! Yes, Tea? Coffee? Pumpkin juice? Fine, There you go, Ron. Drink up. What? I don’t know what you’re talking about, Hark who’s talking, Confunded anyone lately? Nearly time, Right, What? He’s ill? What’s wrong with him? Fishy, isn’t it? Malfoy not playing? What? We’ll be starting in about five minutes, you’d better get your boots on. That’s right, Hit a Bludger at him! Oi, Harper! How much did Malfoy pay you to come on instead of him? YES! Ginny, where’re you going? What are you two talking about? No, I didn’t, I didn’t put it in! You saved everything because you felt lucky. You did it all yourself. Er, shall . . . shall we go up to the party, then? Hermione? Yeah . . . they’re — er — really good. . . . Er . . . does he? For the last time, I am not giving back this book, I’ve learned more from the Half-Blood Prince than Snape or Slughorn have taught me in — Why didn’t you confiscate them then? There isn’t anyone I want to invite, Hang on a moment, I thought Filch had banned anything bought at Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes? But I thought all the owls were being searched. So how come these girls are able to bring love potions into school? You know a lot about it. Yeah, well, never mind that, The point is, Filch is being fooled, isn’t he? These girls are getting stuff into the school disguised as something else! So why couldn’t Malfoy have brought the necklace into the school — ? Come on, why not? Easy for you to say, It isn’t the library’s, it’s mine! It’s just a book that’s been written on! It’s not my fault she’s barking mad, Hermione. Or d’you think she overheard you being rude about Filch? I’ve always thought there might be something going on between them. . . . Baubles, No thanks, I don’t like it much. Oh — right — thanks a lot, Er — I’m just going over here with . . . Hi, Luna Hermione, you left your stuff. Yeah, they’ve had a row I s’pose, So have you had a good term? How would you like to come to Slughorn’s party with me tonight? Yeah, We’re supposed to bring guests, so I thought you might like . . . I mean . . . I mean, just as friends, you know. But if you don’t want to . . . No, that was a mistake. I’ll get Hermione to put it right for me. So, I’ll meet you in the entrance hall at eight o’clock then. Nice to keep these things private, You could say sorry, What did you have to imitate her for? So did I, it was the stupidest thing I’ve ever seen. Hi, How’re you? You’re staying at Hogwarts, then? I heard your parents wanted you to leave. Hi! Shall we get going then? Slughorn’s office, Did you hear, there’s supposed to be a vampire coming? I — what? You mean the Minister of Magic? Er, were you? I’m definitely not interested, and I’ve just seen a friend of mine, sorry. Hermione! Hermione! What’s happened to you? Serves you right for coming with him, You considered Smith? Let’s get something straight. Are you planning to tell Ron that you interfered at Keeper tryouts? Hermione, if you can ask out McLaggen — Good, Because he’ll just fall apart again, and we’ll lose the next match — No, sorry, Hello, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Charms, Transfiguration, Herbology . . . Yeah, well, that’s what I’d like to do, I’ll be back in a bit, Luna — er — bathroom. If you ask that once more, Yes, Snape was offering to help him! He said he’d promised Malfoy’s mother to protect him, that he’d made an Unbreakable Oath or something — Yes, I’m sure, Why, what does it mean? I’d worked that much out for myself, funnily enough. What happens if you break it, then? Yeah, well, passing over Fred’s left buttock — I couldn’t, I promised Dumbledore I wouldn’t wander off while I’m staying here. Yep, I’m going to tell anyone who can put a stop to it, and Dumbledore’s top of the list. I might have another word with your dad too. I couldn’t have done, could I? That was the whole point, he was refusing to tell Snape. They didn’t hear him, No one’s that good an actor, not even Snape. You think I’m right, though?” What? What? How come they like Voldemort? Who’s Greyback? What? When — when you were a kid, you mean? But you are normal! Have you ever heard of someone called the Half-Blood Prince? Prince, Prince, It’s nothing to do with me! He wrote spells all over it, spells he invented. One of them was Levicorpus — My dad used it, I saw him in the Pensieve, he used it on Snape. But it sounds like it was invented while you were at school, And it wasn’t Sirius? Or you? Prince, I just thought — well, he’s helped me out a lot in Potions classes, the Prince has. I dunno, I’ve never checked. What? Nice, Classy. You should definitely wear it in front of Fred and George. Stutter at me? Come on, would I? My Sweetheart Have you ever let it slip that you’d like to go out in public with the words ‘My Sweetheart’ round your neck? Snogging I dunno. They were at Slughorn’s party together, but I don’t think it went that well. D’you reckon this is safe to open? I didn’t think of giving Kreacher anything. Do people usually give their house-elves Christmas presents? I’d rather have them than that necklace, Tonks’s Patronus has changed its form. Snape said so anyway. I didn’t know that could happen. Why would your Patronus change? It looked big, and it had four legs, Hey . . . it couldn’t be — ? Yeah, all right, No, Yeah, we’ve discussed it. Sorry, but that’s between us, I don’t really know what you mean, Minister. What d’you mean? ‘Stand alongside the Ministry’ . . . What does that mean? So basically, you’d like to give the impression that I’m working for the Ministry? But if I keep running in and out of the Ministry, won’t that seem as though I approve of what the Ministry’s up to? No, I don’t think that’ll work, You see, I don’t like some of the things the Ministry’s doing. Locking up Stan Shunpike, for instance. Dumbledore’s a lot older than sixteen, and he doesn’t think Stan should be in Azkaban either, You’re making Stan a scapegoat, just like you want to make me a mascot. I don’t want to be used Yeah, and others might say it’s your duty to check that people really are Death Eaters before you chuck them in prison, You’re doing what Barty Crouch did. You never get it right, you people, do you? I thought you said it didn’t matter either way? Not to you anyway. No, it was honest, One of the only honest things you’ve said to me. You don’t care whether I live or die, but you do care that I help you convince everyone you’re winning the war against Voldemort. I haven’t forgotten, Minister. . . . I don’t remember you rushing to my defense when I was trying to tell everyone Voldemort was back. The Ministry wasn’t so keen to be pals last year. No, No, I wouldn’t You can try, But you seem cleverer than Fudge, so I’d have thought you’d have learned from his mistakes. He tried interfering at Hogwarts.You might have noticed he’s not Minister anymore, but Dumbledore’s still headmaster. I’d leave Dumbledore alone, if I were you. Yeah, I am, Glad we straightened that out. I always do, Mrs. Weasley, I like a quiet life, you know me. “Hogwarts!” No, Professor. What’s up with her? Great, I’ve got loads to tell him — and you. Let’s sit down — So how was your Christmas? I’ll tell you in a minute, Look, Hermione, can’t you — ? I thought maybe, you know, over Christmas — — he was pretending to offer help so that he could trick Malfoy into telling him what he’s doing? Ron’s dad and Lupin think so, But this definitely proves Malfoy’s planning something, you can’t deny that. And he’s acting on Voldemort’s orders, just like I said! I’m not sure . . . Snape definitely said ‘your master,’ and who else would that be? Not great, Have you heard of this Fenrir Greyback? When, History of Magic? You know full well I never listened . . . I forgot! But this proves Malfoy’s a Death Eater, how else could he be in contact with Greyback and telling him what to do? Oh, come on, you can’t get round this one! You’re unbelievable, you are, We’ll see who’s right. . . . You’ll be eating your words, Hermione, just like the Ministry. Oh yeah, I had a row with Rufus Scrimgeour as well. . . . I dunno, Maybe it’s better when you do it yourself, I didn’t enjoy it much when Dumbledore took me along for the ride. Charlie failed, though, didn’t he? When can we take the actual test? Yeah, but you wouldn’t be able to Apparate in here, not in the castle . . . Yes. He’s not very happy with me. He wanted me to tell the Wizarding community that the Ministry’s doing a wonderful job. After everything Fudge did last year? After Umbridge? So that’s why you argued! It was in the Daily Prophet. He accused me of being ‘Dumbledore’s man through and through. ’ I told him I was. Scrimgeour wanted to know where you go when you’re not at Hogwarts, So they still don’t know where you go? There is, actually, sir, It’s about Malfoy and Snape. Yes, I overheard them during Professor Slughorn’s party .. . well, I followed them, actually. . . . Not of great importance? Professor, did you understand — ? I don’t think what you’ve got to say is unimportant, sir, Is that all? Why did it go dark, what happened? So Voldemort stole Morfin’s wand and used it? And Morfin never realized he hadn’t done it? But he had this real memory in him all the time! But how come the Ministry didn’t realize that Voldemort had done all that to Morfin? He was underage at the time, wasn’t he? I thought they could detect underage magic! Dobby, So if you’re underage and you do magic inside an adult witch or wizard’s house, the Ministry won’t know? Well, that’s rubbish, Look what happened here, look what happened to Morfin! Is that all? Tampered with? But why would he do that? But surely, sir, you don’t need me — you could use Legilimency . . . or Veritaserum. . . . “Good night, sir.” You haven’t? Ron reckons I should just hang back after Potions this afternoon. . . . Hermione, can’t you — ? Nothing, It would’ve just looked stupid if we’d both done it! Look, I had to try and soften him up so I could ask him about Voldemort, didn’t I? Oh, will you get a grip! I tell my friends what I’m up to, if I want them to keep a lookout for me, I didn’t feel anything, I’m not fussed, really, I prefer flying, Look, hurry up, will you, there’s something I want to do. . . . Up here, Malfoy’s using Crabbe and Goyle as lookouts. He was arguing with Crabbe just now. I want to know — aha. I solemnly swear that I am up to no good . . . or Malfoy is anyway. Help me find Malfoy, Well, I’m keeping an eye on him from now on, And the moment I see him lurking somewhere with Crabbe and Goyle keeping watch outside, it’ll be on with the old Invisibility Cloak and off to find out what he’s — Not a big surprise, though, is it? Not after what happened to Katie. Happy birthday, Ron, Have a present. Right, I solemnly swear that I am up to no good, No problem, Hey . . . I don’t think he’s in his bed. . . . Cool, No thanks, Malfoy’s gone again! Mischief managed, Ready? Ron? Breakfast. I thought you just said — ? You’ve just eaten half a box of Chocolate Cauldrons, haven’t you? Fair enough, What You can’t stand what? Why does that stop you having breakfast? She definitely knows you exist, She keeps snogging you, doesn’t she? “Who are you talking about?” Who are you talking about? This is a joke, right? You’re joking. Okay, okay . . . Say that again with a straight face. This is really funny and everything, but joke’s over, all right? Drop it. What? Where did you get those Chocolate Cauldrons? You just picked them up off the floor, didn’t you? They didn’t fall off your bed, you prat, don’t you understand? Yeah, I’ll introduce you, I’m going to let you down now, okay? She’ll be in Slughorn’s office, Oh, she has extra Potions lessons with him, Great idea, Professor, I’m really sorry to disturb you, but my friend Ron’s swallowed a love potion by mistake. You couldn’t make him an antidote, could you? I’d take him to Madam Pomfrey, but we’re not supposed to have anything from Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes and, you know . . . awkward questions . . . Er, well, I’ve never mixed an antidote for a love potion, sir, and by the time I get it right, Ron might’ve done something serious — That would explain a lot, It’s his birthday, Professor, She’s not here yet, Back to normal, then?   Thanks a lot, Professor. Ron Ron! Professor! Do something! . . . and then I got the bezoar down his throat and his breathing eased up a bit, Slughorn ran for help, McGonagall and Madam Pomfrey turned up, and they brought Ron up here. They reckon he’ll be all right. Madam Pomfrey says he’ll have to stay here a week or so . . . keep taking essence of rue . . . Lucky there was one in the room, Yes, Slughorn poured it out — Probably, but why would Slughorn want to poison Ron? Dumbledore reckons Voldemort wanted Slughorn on his side, Slughorn was in hiding for a year before he came to Hogwarts. And . . . And maybe Voldemort wants him out of the way, maybe he thinks he could be valuable to Dumbledore. Not bad, They say he’ll be okay. That’s just what we were discussing, We don’t know. Don’t be . . . I didn’t . . . What? Dumbledore’s angry with Snape? Hagrid, why is Dumbledore angry with Snape? What? What’s Snape done? Well? What? Yeah, but Dumbledore’s not having rows with the rest of them, is he? Oh . . . right . . . Quidditch, Yeah . . . he might not make it. Yeah, Yeah, I suppose so. . . . What? Oh . . . there’s one tomorrow evening. Right, Well, I’ll hear them tomorrow, then. I’m pretty tired now . . . see you . . . Look, why don’t you talk to Ron about all this? Is he? Yeah, I think so. Well, they’re friends, aren’t they? Would you call getting poisoned being interesting? asked Harry. Anyway — sorry, got to go — there’s McLaggen coming for a talk about Quidditch I’ve told you, he could be world-class and I wouldn’t want to keep him. He keeps trying to tell everyone what to do, he thinks he could play every position better than the rest of us. I can’t wait to be shot of him. And speaking of getting shot of people, will you stop pretending to be asleep when Lavender comes to see you? She’s driving me mad as well. If you don’t want to go out with her anymore, just tell her No, she’s already gone down to the pitch with Ginny. I’ll try, See you after the match. I met Malfoy, So I wanted to know how come he’s up at the castle with a couple of girlfriends while everyone else is down here. . . . Well, I’m not likely to find out, am I? Come on then! I’m the Captain, McLaggen, shut up giving them instructions, Just get up by the goalposts! Make sure you do fly out of the sun, McLaggen, will you pay attention to what you’re supposed to be doing and leave everyone else alone! Will you give him back his bat and get back to the goalposts! What happened? I don’t want to stay here overnight, I want to find McLaggen and kill him. D’you know how much we lost by? Brilliant, Really brilliant! When I get hold of McLaggen — . . Yeah . . . well, I saw Malfoy sneaking off with a couple of girls who didn’t look like they wanted to be with him, and that’s the second time he’s made sure he isn’t down on the Quidditch pitch with the rest of the school; he skipped the last match too, remember? Wish I’d followed him now, the match was such a fiasco. . . . I want to know what he’s up to. And don’t tell me it’s all in my head, not after what I overheard between him and Snape — I want to catch him at it! I mean, where’s he going when he disappears off the map? I’ve never seen him going along any of the secret passageways on the map. I thought they were being watched now anyway? Kreacher? Muffliato! Langlock! Yeah, Right — I’m forbidding you to fight each other! Well, Kreacher, you’re forbidden to fight Dobby. Dobby, I know I’m not allowed to give you orders — Okay then, Yeah, I did, I’ve got a job for you. . . Okay then . . . I want you to tail Draco Malfoy. I want to know where he’s going, who he’s meeting, and what he’s doing. I want you to follow him around the clock. There won’t be any need for that, . . And you’re forbidden to tip him off, Kreacher, or to show him what you’re up to, or to talk to him at all, or to write him messages or . . . or to contact him in any way. Got it? That’s settled, then, I’ll want regular reports, but make sure I’m not surrounded by people when you turn up.Ron and Hermione are okay.  And don’t tell anyone what you’re doing. Just stick to Malfoy like a couple of wart plasters. Professor Trelawney still isn’t happy Firenze is teaching, then? Ah, Well, I asked Professor Slughorn about it at the end of Potions, sir, but, er, he wouldn’t give it to me. Well, Well . . . the day Ron swallowed love potion by mistake I took him to Professor Slughorn. I thought maybe if I got Professor Slughorn in a good enough mood — Sir, it isn’t that I wasn’t bothered or anything, I’ve just had other — other things . . . Professor Dumbledore, I’m really sorry. I should have done more. . . . I should have realized you wouldn’t have asked me to do it if it wasn’t really important. Sir, Sir, Voldemort killed his father and his grandparents and made it look as though his Uncle Morfin did it. Then he went back to Hogwarts and he asked . . . he asked Professor Slughorn about Horcruxes, Yes, sir. At Borgin and Burkes? He wanted to stay here? But he didn’t get the job, sir? How did you feel about that, sir? Which job did he want, sir? What subject did he want to teach? I’ll bet he was, No way! Hokey confessed? Voldemort modified her memory, just like he did with Morfin! — because she was a house-elf, But, it seems mad. . . . Risking everything, throwing away his job, just for those . . . The locket maybe, but why take the cup as well? Whose memory is it? Why? Why did he come back? Did you ever find out? What ideas, sir? Was he after the Defense Against the Dark Arts job again, sir? He didn’t say. . . . Don’t start, Hermione, If it hadn’t been for the Prince, Ron wouldn’t be sitting here now. I’ve only done it once, Yeah, I know that, thanks, That’s why I’m looking for something different. Dumbledore says Veritaserum won’t do it, but there might be something else, a potion or a spell. . . . Why don’t you ditch her if you want to finish it? Sort of fell apart, yeah, Kreacher! Well . . . they’ve been following Malfoy for me, he said. No, of course I didn’t, Dobby, you can sleep, all right? But has either of you found out anything? Yeah, we don’t need to hear about you being in love with Malfoy, Let’s fast forward to where he’s actually been going. Dobby, you tell me, Has he been going anywhere he shouldn’t have? The Room of Requirement! That’s where he’s been sneaking off to! That’s where he’s doing . . . whatever he’s doing! And I bet that’s why he’s been disappearing off the map — come to think of it, I’ve never seen the Room of Requirement on there! Dobby, have you managed to get in to have a look at what Malfoy’s doing? No, it’s not, Malfoy got into our headquarters there last year, so I’ll be able to get in and spy on him, no problem. There’ll be a way around that, You’ve done brilliantly, Dobby. Get out of it, You’d better go and get some sleep too, Dobby. How good’s this? We know where Malfoy’s going! We’ve got him cornered now! Yeah, that is weird, I heard him telling Crabbe it wasn’t Crabbe’s business what he was doing . . . so what’s he telling all these . . . all these . . . God, I’ve been stupid, It’s obvious, isn’t it? There was a great vat of it down in the dungeon. . . . He could’ve nicked some any time during that lesson. . . . Polyjuice Potion. He stole some of the Polyjuice Potion Slughorn showed us in our first Potions lesson. . . . There aren’t a whole variety of students standing guard for Malfoy . . . it’s just Crabbe and Goyle as usual. Yeah, it all fits! They’re stupid enough to do what they’re told even if he won’t tell them what he’s up to . . . but he doesn’t want them to be seen lurking around outside the Room of Requirement, so he’s got them taking Polyjuice to make them look like other people. . . . Those two girls I saw him with when he missed Quidditch — ha! Crabbe and Goyle! Yeah, of course! Of course! Malfoy must’ve been inside the room at the time, so she — what am I talking about? — he dropped the scales to tell Malfoy not to come out, because there was someone there! And there was that girl who dropped the toadspawn too! We’ve been walking past him all the time and not realizing it! I won’t, We’ll see, We’ll see, What d’you think? Look, I haven’t forgotten about Slughorn, but I haven’t got a clue how to get that memory off him, and until I get a brain wave why shouldn’t I find out what Malfoy’s doing? Er — well — ghosts are transparent — Yeah, ghosts are transparent, but Inferi are dead bodies, aren’t they? So they’d be solid — You might as well do the extra practice sessions in Hogsmeade and see where they get you, It’ll be more interesting than trying to get into a stupid hoop anyway. Then, if you’re still not — you know — as good as you’d like to be, you can postpone the test, do it with me over the summ — Myrtle, this is the boys’ bathroom! I thought you lived in that girls’ bathroom? Vividly, There’s been a boy in here crying? A young boy? I’ve been trying! He doesn’t want to talk to me, Hermione! He can tell I’ve been trying to get him on his own again, and he’s not going to let it happen! I solemnly swear that I am up to no good, Hello . . . you’re very pretty, aren’t you? OUCH! What’re you doing here? His office isn’t here, it’s round the other side of the castle, behind the gargoyle — Has he? Hey — you don’t know where he goes, I suppose? What did you want to see him about? I do, I’m sorry, I mean . . . I miss him, as well. . . . Good one, How’d you do, Hermione? Yep, And guess who I ran into up there? Tonks! Yeah, she said she’d come to visit Dumbledore. . . . If you ask me, she’s cracking up a bit. Losing her nerve after what happened at the Ministry. I had a thought, You don’t think she can have been . . . you know . . . in love with Sirius? I dunno, but she was nearly crying when I mentioned his name . . . and her Patronus is a big four-legged thing now. . . . I wondered whether it hadn’t become . . . you know . . . him. Thanks . . . Dumbledore said we wouldn’t be having any more lessons until I got the memory! Look at this, We’ve been down to see him by night before, Hagrid Fifty-seventh time lucky, you think? What d’you mean? Felix Felicis? I dunno . . . I was sort of saving it. . . . Yes, of course, He died? But surely werewolves don’t kill, they just turn you into one of them? What was the werewolf’s name? You’ll do fine, Good luck. Oh . . . yeah, maybe, Sir, Professor — Professor, don’t you want to taste my po — ? Well done! And Ron? No joy, Yeah, I s’pose I’d better, I don’t reckon I’ll need all of it, not twelve hours’ worth, it can’t take all night. . . . I’ll just take a mouthful. Two or three hours should do it. Good evening, Professor. I think Filch must’ve forgotten to lock the doors, He’s pretty upset. . . . But you won’t tell anyone, Professor? I don’t want trouble for him. . . .  But this one, Aragog, the first one Hagrid ever got, it died last night. He’s devastated. He wants company while he buries it and I said I’d go. well, if you wanted to come, Professor, Hagrid would probably be really pleased. . . . Give Aragog a better send-off, you know . . . Yeah — Ron and Hermione couldn’t, though. They’re really sorry. Where are we burying him?  The forest?  No,  He was talking about my mum and dad dying. No — well, I was only one when they died, But I’ve found out pretty much what happened since. My dad died first. Did you know that? Yeah . . . Voldemort murdered him and then stepped over his body toward my mum,  He told her to get out of the way, He told me she needn’t have died. He only wanted me. She could have run. It is, isn’t it? But she didn’t move. Dad was already dead, but she didn’t want me to go too.  She tried to plead with Voldemort .. . but he just laughed. . . . I forgot, You liked her, didn’t you? But you won’t help her son. She gave me her life, but you won’t give me a memory. It can, Dumbledore needs information. I need information. I am the Chosen One. I have to kill him. I need that memory. Of course I am, You don’t want to get rid of the wizard who killed Lily Evans? You’re scared he’ll find out you helped me? Be brave like my mother, Professor. . . . You’d cancel out anything you did by giving me the memory, It would be a very brave and noble thing to do. Thank you very much, Professor. I’m really sorry — I had to go out for something important — You’re joking! Why did it have to change at midnight? Fantastic, Really brilliant. Yeah, I would go and take it up with Dumbledore if he was here, because he’s the one who wanted me to — Where is he? Not the Bloody Baron — Dumbledore! toffee éclairs Sir — I’ve got it. I’ve got the memory from Slughorn. I was ripped from my body, I was less than spirit, less than the meanest ghost . . . but still, I was alive. You think he succeeded then, sir? He made a Horcrux? And that’s why he didn’t die when he attacked me? He had a Horcrux hidden somewhere? A bit of his soul was safe? Where? How? I don’t understand, sir, I still don’t understand, Well, He wanted people to know he was Slytherin’s heir, because he couldn’t take credit at the time. So he’s made himself impossible to kill by murdering other people? Why couldn’t he make a Sorcerer’s Stone, or steal one, if he was so interested in immortality? He made seven Horcruxes? But the six Horcruxes, then, how are we supposed to find them? You have? But how did you find it? And they could be anything? They could be old tin cans or, I dunno, empty potion bottles. . . . The diary wasn’t that special. So, the other Horcruxes? Do you think you know what they are, sir? The locket! Hufflepuff’s cup! Do you think that’s why he really wanted to come back to Hogwarts, sir? Even if he got something of Ravenclaw’s or of Gryffindor’s, that leaves a sixth Horcrux, Unless he got both? The snake? You can use animals as Horcruxes? So, said Harry, the diary’s gone, the ring’s gone. The cup, the locket, and the snake are still intact, and you think there might be a Horcrux that was once Ravenclaw’s or Gryffindor’s? So . . . are you still looking for them, sir? And if you do, can I come with you and help get rid of it? I can? Does Voldemort know when a Horcrux is destroyed, sir? Can he feel it? But I thought he meant Lucius Malfoy to smuggle it into Hogwarts? So if all of his Horcruxes are destroyed, Voldemort could be killed? But I haven’t got uncommon skill and power, I know! I can love! Big deal! So, when the prophecy says that I’ll have ‘power the Dark Lord knows not,’ it just means — love? But it comes to the same — But, But, but last year, you said one of us would have to kill the other — But — Of course not! He killed my mum and dad! But, it all comes to the same thing, doesn’t it? I’ve got to try and kill him, or — I’d want him finished, And I’d want to do it. That one of us is going to end up killing the other, Ah, Well — you don’t mind it’s over, do you? How come? What d’you mean? Oh — oh yeah, Ah, well, now you’re back and Ron’s fit, we’ll have a decent chance of thrashing Ravenclaw, which means we could still be in the running for the Cup. Listen, Katie . . . . . . that necklace . . . can you remember who gave it to you now? Or someone who looked like a girl or a woman, Don’t forget, there was a cauldron full of Polyjuice Potion at Hogwarts. We know some of it got stolen. . . . I think I’m going to take another swig of Felix, said Harry, and have a go at the Room of Requirement again. Blimey, it’s seriously complicated, And it takes six months . . . You’ve got to let it stew. . . . SECTUMSEMPRA! No No No — I didn’t — I didn’t mean it to happen, I didn’t know what that spell did. I — read about it somewhere. It was — a library book, I need your book, Your Potions book. Quick . . .give it to me . . . I’ll explain later! Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, “That’s my nickname, Yeah . . . that’s what my friends call me I — I don’t agree, sir, But sir . . . Quidditch . . . the last match of the . . . Yes, Yes, Will you stop harping on about the book! The Prince only copied it out! It’s not like he was advising anyone to use it! For all we know, he was making a note of something that had been used against him! I’m not defending what I did! I wish I hadn’t done it, and not just because I’ve got about a dozen detentions. And get the book? Yeah, I am, Listen, without the Prince I’d never have won the Felix Felicis. I’d never have known how to save Ron from poisoning, I’d never have — Right, Professor, Yes, sir. Quid agis? What did you tell her? Thanks, And what did you tell her Ron’s got? What about? Oh, not again, Will you please drop it? He didn’t make a hobby of it — We’ve been through this, Prince, Hermione, Prince! “So?” No way. You think she was the Half-Blood . . . ? Oh, come on. Yeah, very ingenious, Hermione . . . Listen, Hermione, I can tell it’s not a girl. I can just tell. How can I have hung round with you for five years and not think girls are clever? It’s the way he writes, I just know the Prince was a bloke, I can tell. This girl hasn’t got anything to do with it. Where did you get this anyway? Enjoy yourself, You don’t think I’m mad, wanting that book back, do you? Nor am I, Yeah, Thanks to Snape . . . Yeah, and the Saturday after that, and the Saturday after that, And he’s hinting now that if I don’t get all the boxes done by the end of term, we’ll carry on next year. Thanks, Jimmy . . . Hey, it’s from Dumbledore! He wants me to go to his office as quick as I can! Better go and see, hadn’t I? Professor — What happened, Professor? Professor, were you trying to get into the Room of Requirement? The Room of Requirement, Were you trying to get in there? Not all of them do, But what happened? You screamed. . . . It sounded as though you were hurt. . . . Right, But you couldn’t get in and hide them? Somebody in — ? Who? Who was in there? What? Saying what? Whooping? Was it male or female? And it sounded happy? What? And then — ? You couldn’t have found out who it was without asking? Right, And did the voice say who was there? And you didn’t see that coming? I think you’d better tell Professor Dumbledore, He ought to know Malfoy’s celebrating — I mean, that someone threw you out of the room. Right, What? What? You stay here, You stay here! You stay here, You stay here! Come . . . with you . . . ? If I . . . You’ve found one? You’ve found a Horcrux? I’m not scared! Which Horcrux is it? Where is it? Yes, How is it protected? I’m coming, Nothing, I’m not upset. Snape! Snape’s what’s happened! He told Voldemort about the prophecy, it was him, he listened outside the door, Trelawney told me! Just now! AND YOU LET HIM TEACH HERE AND HE TOLD VOLDEMORT TO GO AFTER MY MUM AND DAD! Don’t tell me it was a mistake, sir, he was listening at the door! He hated my dad like he hated Sirius! Haven’t you noticed, Professor, how the people Snape hates tend to end up dead? But he’s a very good Occlumens, isn’t he, sir? And isn’t Voldemort convinced that Snape’s on his side, even now? Professor . . . how can you be sure Snape’s on our side? Well, I don’t! He’s up to something with Draco Malfoy right now, right under your nose, and you still — You’re leaving the school tonight, and I’ll bet you haven’t even considered that Snape and Malfoy might decide to — I . . . they’re up to something! Professor Trelawney was just in the Room of Requirement, trying to hide her sherry bottles, and she heard Malfoy whooping, celebrating! I didn’t — Yes, Of course. Of course. Yes. Yes. Yes Yes. I- Yes, sir. No, listen! Dumbledore won’t be here tonight, so Malfoy’s going to have another clear shot at whatever he’s up to. No, listen to me! I know it was Malfoy celebrating in the Room of Requirement. Here — You’ve got to watch him and you’ve got to watch Snape too. Dumbledore says he’s put extra protection in the school, but if Snape’s involved, he’ll know what Dumbledore’s protection is, and how to avoid it — but he won’t be expecting you lot to be on the watch, will he? I haven’t got time to argue, You need what’s wrapped in them, it’s the Felix Felicis. Share it between yourselves and Ginny too. Say good-bye to her for me. I’d better go, Dumbledore’s waiting — I’ll be fine, I’ll be with Dumbledore, I want to know you lot are okay. . . . Don’t look like that, Hermione, I’ll see you later. . . . But what will people think when they see you leaving, Professor? Professor, will we be Apparating? Yes, Yes, Yes, but I haven’t got a license. They brought the kids from the orphanage here? No, How can you tell? You’ve d-done it! Thank you, What is it, Professor? Payment? You’ve got to give the door something? Blood? Yeah, but still, if you can avoid it . . . Professor! I’ll do it, I’m — Professor? Do you think the Horcrux is here? We couldn’t . . . we couldn’t just try a Summoning Charm? Me? Oh . . . okay . . . Accio Horcrux! What was that? Did you think that would happen, sir? But we don’t know what the thing was, Professor? Do you think we’re going to have to go into the lake? You don’t think the Horcrux is at the bottom? So we’re going to have to cross the lake to get to it? How did you know that was there? Is . . . is this boat safe? So the things in the water won’t do anything to us if we cross in Voldemort’s boat? But why have they let us? It doesn’t look like it was built for two people. Will it hold both of us? Will we be too heavy together? But then — ? Professor! I think I saw a hand in the water — a human hand! So that thing that jumped out of the water — ? There are bodies in here! At the moment? But one of them jumped, When I tried to Summon the Horcrux, a body leapt out of the lake. Oh . . . right . . . What is it? Sir, no, don’t touch — ! You think the Horcrux is in there, sir? What? No! But what if — what if it kills you? Sir, sir, this is Voldemort we’re — But what if — ? Yes, but — Yes, Yes, but — Yes, Why can’t I drink the potion instead? Couldn’t — ? Yes, but — but- but — But — I — all right, but — Professor? How do you feel? Professor? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? You . . . you can’t stop, Professor, You’ve got to keep drinking, remember? You told me you had to keep drinking. Here . . . It’s all right, Professor, It’s all right, I’m here — Yes . . . yes, this’ll make it stop, It’s all right, Professor, Nothing’s happening to you, you’re safe, it isn’t real, I swear it isn’t real — take this, now, take this. . . . This will make it stop, Professor, Here, drink this, drink this, you’ll be all right, Just drink, Professor, just drink . . . We’re nearly there, Professor. Drink this, drink it. . . . Drink this, Professor. Drink this. . . . This — this one will! Just drink this . . . It’ll be over . . . all over! No! No, no, you’re not dead, you said it wasn’t poison, wake up, wake up — Rennervate! Rennervate — sir — please — Sir, Water, Aguamenti! Aguamenti! Sir, Aguamenti — Aguamenti — AGUAMENTI! Sir — here! Petrificus Totalus! Petrificus Totalus! Impedimenta! Incarcerous! Sectumsempra! SECTUMSEMPRA! Sir, sir, I forgot — about fire — they were coming at me and I panicked — Sir, Don’t worry, I’ll get us back. . . . Lean on me, sir. . . . Don’t talk now, Save your energy, sir. . . . We’ll soon be out of here. . . . There’s no need, I got cut on the rock, Just tell me where. . . . Sir, We’re nearly there. . . . I can Apparate us both back. . . . Don’t worry. . . . We did it, Professor! We did it! We got the Horcrux! Sir, are you all right? Sir — it’s okay, sir, you’re going to be all right, don’t worry — We need to get you up to the school, sir. . . . Madam Pomfrey . . . Right — sir, listen — I’m going to knock on a door, find a place you can stay — then I can run and get Madam He’s hurt, Madam Rosmerta, can he come into the Three Broomsticks while I go up to the school and get help for him? If you help me support him, Accio Rosmerta’s Brooms! What does it mean? Is it the real Mark? Has someone definitely been — Professor? But — Petrificus Totalus! Petrificus Totalus! Impedimenta! Neville, are you — ? I know, I’m on it! Out of the way! not Hagrid . . . not Hagrid too . . . Impedimenta! Stupefy! Cruc — Cruc — Incarc — Fight back! Fight back, you cowardly — Stupe — Impedi — Sectum — ! Levi — Kill me then, Kill me like you killed him, you coward — Hagrid, HAGRID? M’all right, Are you? We should put out your house, the charm’s ‘Aguamenti’ . . . Aguamenti! Aguamenti! Hagrid . . . not Hagrid . . . not Hagrid too . . . Hagrid, Hagrid, he killed . . . Dumbledore, Snape killed . . . Dumbledore. He . . . Snape killed him. I saw it happen. I saw it, Hagrid. No No. No No. I’m not hurt, Ginny, who else is dead? But the Dark Mark — Malfoy said he stepped over a body — Are you sure? But the others . . . There were other bodies on the ground. . . . I’m fine. . . . How’s Bill? Can’t you fix them with a charm or something? Snape killed him, I was there, I saw it. We arrived back on the Astronomy Tower because that’s where the Mark was. . . . Dumbledore was ill, he was weak, but I think he realized it was a trap when we heard footsteps running up the stairs. He immobilized me, I couldn’t do anything, I was under the Invisibility Cloak — and then Malfoy came through the door and disarmed him — — more Death Eaters arrived — and then Snape — and Snape did it. The Avada Kedavra. Snape killed Dumbledore, I know, Snape passed Voldemort the information that made Voldemort hunt down my mum and dad. And he didn’t think my mother was worth a damn either, because she was Muggle-born. . . . ‘Mudblood,’ he called her. . . . So when he arrived at the fight, he joined in on the Death Eaters’ side? I know, So they got in through the Room of Requirement. To set off the Mark? So if Ron was watching the Room of Requirement with Ginny and Neville, were you — ? What? What? but to help them, not to stop them . . . and I’ll bet you had to have a Dark Mark to get through that barrier — so what happened when he came back down? He’d done what he’d meant to do. “See you in a bit” I can’t tell you that, Professor, It is, very, but he didn’t want me to tell anyone. I don’t think so, Professor Dumbledore never told me to stop following his orders if he died. There’s one thing you should know before the Ministry gets here, though. Madam Rosmerta’s under the Imperius Curse, she was helping Malfoy and the Death Eaters, that’s how the necklace and the poisoned mead — What about Dumbledore’s funeral? Then that’s what’ll happen, isn’t it? And in that case, you shouldn’t send the students home until the funeral’s over. They’ll want to say — Can I leave, Professor? Yes, They’re talking about closing the school, We don’t yet know, She’s not that bad, Ugly, though, Of course there isn’t, They won’t find Snape till they find Voldemort, and seeing as they’ve never managed to do that in all this time . . . R.A.B.? . . the cup . . . the snake . . . something of Gryffindor’s or Ravenclaw’s . What about him? D’you have to rub it in, Hermione? How d’you think I feel about that now? — murderer, Yeah, that fits, He’d play up the pure-blood side so he could get in with Lucius Malfoy and the rest of them. . . . He’s just like Voldemort. Pure-blood mother, Muggle father . . . ashamed of his parentage, trying to make himself feared using the Dark Arts, gave himself an impressive new name — Lord Voldemort — the Half-Blood Prince — how could Dumbledore have missed — ? He knew, He knew when I used Sectumsempra.  He didn’t really need Legilimency.. . . He might even have known before then, with Slughorn talking about how brilliant I was at Potions. . . . Shouldn’t have left his old book in the bottom of that cupboard, should he? I should’ve shown the book to Dumbledore, All that time he was showing me how Voldemort was evil even when he was at school, and I had proof Snape was too — You were the one who kept telling me the book was dangerous! No, What do you want? What do you want? Whose word? Glad to hear it, Well, where I went with Dumbledore and what we did is my business. He didn’t want people to know. He will only be gone from the school when none here are loyal to him, I am not saying he can. You wouldn’t understand. But I’ve got nothing to tell you. Voldemort wants to kill me himself, and Aurors won’t stop him. So thanks for the offer, but no thanks. What request? Oh yeah . . . the one where I tell the world what a great job you’re doing in exchange for — Released Stan Shunpike yet? Dumbledore’s man through and through, That’s right. What do you see when you look in the mirror? Lies! Yes? What a surprise, Some of ‘my lot,’ right, The house? What house? The house? A plot to get this house? Are you actually as stupid as you look? Just in case you’ve forgotten, I’ve already got a house, my godfather left me one. So why would I want this one? All the happy memories? — Voldemort, and we’ve been through this about a hundred times already. This isn’t a claim, it’s fact, Dumbledore told you last year, and Kingsley and Mr. Weasley — — Kingsley and Mr. Weasley explained it all as well, Once I’m seventeen, the protective charm that keeps me safe will break, and that exposes you as well as me. The Order is sure Voldemort will target you, whether to torture you to try and find out where I am, or because he thinks by holding you hostage I’d come and try to rescue you. You’ve got to go into hiding and the Order wants to help. You’re being offered serious protection, the best there is. There is, You heard what Mr. Weasley and Kingsley said, We think the Ministry has been infiltrated. As I’ve told you, Kingsley is protecting the Mug — I mean, your Prime Minister. Well, he’s taken, These accidents aren’t accidents — the crashes and explosions and derailments and whatever else has happened since we last watched the news. People are disappearing and dying and he’s behind it — Voldemort. I’ve told you this over and over again, he kills Muggles for fun. Even the fogs — they’re caused by dementors, and if you can’t remember what they are, ask your son! More? More? More than the two that attacked us, you mean? Of course there are, there are hundreds, maybe thousands by this time, seeing as they feed off fear and despair — I hope so, because once I’m seventeen, all of them — Death Eaters, dementors, maybe even Inferi — which means dead bodies enchanted by a Dark wizard — will be able to find you and will certainly attack you. And if you remember the last time you tried to outrun wizards, I think you’ll agree you need help. Don’t you understand? They will torture and kill you like they did my parents! Dudley, for the first time in your life, you’re talking sense. They’ll be here in about five minutes, Thanks, Dedalus, It’s really good of you to do this . . . They’re through here, my aunt and uncle and cousin. . . . What d’you mean? I thought Mad-Eye was going to come and take me by Side-Along-Apparition? There’s no need, Not in the slightest, It’s fine, It doesn’t matter, honestly. Er — no, they don’t, They think I’m a waste of space, actually, but I’m used to — Well . . . er . . . thanks, Dudley. Not really, It was your soul the dementor would have taken. . . . Yeah, but coming from Dudley that’s like ‘I love you,’ Oh, right. Thanks. I hope everything’s okay, Dudley, did the dementors blow a different personality into you? Yeah . . . Good-bye, Definitely, But I wasn’t expecting this many of you! Kingsley, I thought you were looking after the Muggle Prime Minister? You got married? That’s brilliant, congrat — I don’t — So what are we going to do? Yeah, Er — yes, Maybe they won’t know which of the twelve secure houses I’m heading for at first, but won’t it be sort of obvious oncefourteen of us fly off toward Tonks’s parents’? No! No way! If you think I’m going to let six people risk their lives — ! This is different, pretending to be me — You can’t do it if I don’t cooperate, you need me to give you some hair. Funny, really amusing. But this is mad, there’s no need — Why’m I with you? That’s great, Is this it? Is this Sirius’s bike? No — HEDWIG! No — NO! Hedwig — Hedwig — Hagrid, we’ve got to go back, we’ve got to go back! Hagrid, TURN AROUND! Hagrid! No! Let me! REPARO! Impedimenta! Confringo! It’s not a problem, just keep flying! Expelliarmus! I don’t know! Hagrid, do the dragon-fire thing again, let’s get out of here! Hagrid! Hagrid — Accio Hagrid! Hagrid? Hagrid? Hagrid, talk to me — He crawled out of the pond and stumbled toward the great dark mass on the ground that was Hagrid. Hagrid? Voldemort — No, Death Eaters, loads of them — we were chased — They knew, Yeah, me too. I can’t believe — You! Oh, I’m — I’m sorry. I — I don’t know, We don’t know what happened to anyone else. The Portkey, We’ve got to get back to the Burrow and find out — then we’ll be able to send you word, or — or Tonks will, once she’s — Yeah, we do, I — I — I — I’ll tell Tonks — Dora — to send word, when she . . . Thanks for patching us up, thanks for everything. I — Thanks, She . . . she got hit, What d’you mean? Isn’t anyone else back? The Death Eaters were waiting for us, We were surrounded the moment we took off — they knew it was tonight — I don’t know what happened to anyone else, four of them chased us, it was all we could do to get away, and then Voldemort caught up with us — Fly, I saw him too, he came after Hagrid and me. Snape? How is he? Yeah, Thank God. Hermione and Kingsley, Yeah, I am, No, I mean . . . if somebody made a mistake, and let something slip, I know they didn’t mean to do it. It’s not their fault, We’ve got to trust each other. I trust all of you, I don’t think anyone in this room would ever sell me to Voldemort. You think I’m a fool? I’ve got to go too, I can’t stay here. You’re all in danger while I’m here. I don’t want — If Voldemort finds out I’m here — It’s not me I’m worried for! I know that — I KNOW! It wasn’t me, It was my wand. My wand acted of its own accord. No, The bike was falling, I couldn’t have told you where Voldemort was, but my wand spun in my hand and found him and shot a spell at him, and it wasn’t even a spell I recognized. I’ve never made gold flames appear before. It wasn’t like that, No, The Trace’ll break on the thirty-first, That means I only need to stay here four days. Then I can — Don’t they realize how important — ? Oh, Well, yeah. We are. Well, Dumbledore left me . . . stuff to do, Ron and Hermione know about it, and they want to come too. I’m sorry, I can’t — Dumbledore didn’t want anyone else to know, Mrs. Weasley. I’m sorry. Ron and Hermione don’t have to come, it’s their choice — I didn’t misunderstand, It’s got to be me. And that’s not mine, I don’t support Puddlemere United. No — I — of course not, And then what does she think’s going to happen? Someone else might kill off Voldemort while she’s holding us here making vol-au-vents? I — not — I was joking, But surely Snape will have told the Death Eaters the address by now? No news about Mad-Eye? And they still haven’t called a hearing about all the underage magic I used escaping the Death Eaters? Because they know I had no choice or because they don’t want me to tell the world Voldemort attacked me? Yeah, why tell the public the truth? And how did you manage to get away? But Bill saw him hit by the Killing Curse, Fleur said his wand was blasted out of his hand, Yeah, Like Barty Crouch, turned into a bone and buried in Hagrid’s front garden. They probably transfigured Moody and stuffed him — Oh, Hermione, I wasn’t trying to upset — Listen, I know you said after Dumbledore’s funeral that you wanted to come with me, Listen! But — — are you sure you’ve thought this through? I — Hermione, I’m sorry — I didn’t — Why? That’s your ghoul, isn’t it? But it . . . it looks . . . do ghouls normally wear pajamas? No, I don’t. And your mum and dad are in on this plan? If we knew where any of the Horcruxes were, I’d agree with you, How? I didn’t think there were any books on Horcruxes in the library? But when did you do this? He only approached Slughorn to find out what would happen if you split your soul into seven, Dumbledore was sure Riddle already knew how to make a Horcrux by the time he asked Slughorn about them. I think you’re right, Hermione, that could easily have been where he got the information. Why? How do you do it? What, stabbing it with a basilisk fang? — phoenix tears, That diary sort of died when I stabbed it, I wonder how Dumbledore destroyed the ring? Why didn’t I ask him? I never really . . . Yeah, then we’ll have nothing to do except find Horcruxes. . . . It’ll be like a holiday, won’t it? I’m sorry, I don’t want a fuss, Really, Mrs. Weasley, just a normal dinner would be fine. . . . It’s the day before the wedding. . . . That’d be great, But please don’t go to loads of trouble. Was I? Who’s Gregorovitch? I think Voldemort’s looking for him. I think he’s abroad. It didn’t look like anywhere in Britain. Do me a favor and don’t tell Hermione, Although how she expects me to stop seeing stuff in my sleep . . . I think, he’s got something to do with Quidditch. There’s some connection, but I can’t — I can’t think what it is. Who, Gregorovitch? No, I’m definitely not thinking of Gorgovitch. Wow — that’s right, I forgot! I’m seventeen! Accio Glasses! A book? Bit of a departure from tradition, isn’t it? Yeah . . . thanks. Nice view, he said feebly, pointing toward the window. I think dating opportunities are going to be pretty thin on the ground, to be honest. I’ll see you later, I’m not messing her around, She’s not an idiot, she knows it can’t happen, she’s not expecting us to — to end up married, or — It won’t happen again, Okay? That looks amazing, Mrs. Weasley. Vaguely, Didn’t you smash down the front door, give Dudley a pig’s tail, and tell me I was a wizard? Hagrid, thanks! Yeah . . . thanks. We’re not going anywhere, You can speak to us together, or not at all. Us? So why have you decided to let us have our things now? Can’t think of a pretext to keep them? No idea, For the reasons you just read out, I suppose . . . to remind me what you can get if you . . . persevere and whatever it was. I suppose so, What else could it be? No, That was dramatic, What? So where is it? Me? Maybe he thought it would look nice on my wall. Was I? Has anyone ever tried sticking a sword in Voldemort? Maybe the Ministry should put some people onto that, instead of wasting their time stripping down Deluminators or covering up breakouts from Azkaban. So is this what you’ve been doing, Minister, shut up in your office, trying to break open a Snitch? People are dying — I was nearly one of them — Voldemort chased me across three counties, he killed Mad-Eye Moody, but there’s been no word about any of that from the Ministry, has there? And you still expect us to cooperate with you! No! D’you want to give him an excuse to arrest us? It’s time you earned it, I don’t like your methods, Minister, Remember? To give us what Dumbledore left us, They’ve only just released the contents of his will. Meet us upstairs, After everyone’s gone to bed. Yeah, well, I wasn’t going to try too hard in front of Scrimgeour, was I? The Snitch I caught in my first ever Quidditch match? Don’t you remember? Exactly, I open at the close . . . at the close . . . I open at the close . . . And why couldn’t he just have told me? It was there, it was right there on the wall of his office during all our talks last year! If he wanted me to have it, why didn’t he just give it to me then? It’s fine, I understand, Er — my name’s Barny, How did you know — ? Really? Are you sure you don’t want to put anything on that bite, though? Cousin, Er — sort of, Barny Weasley. No, I only met him today. Why? Sign? Grindelwald . . . the Dark wizard Dumbledore defeated? Are you — er — quite sure it’s Grindelwald’s — ? Well,  there’s a chance that Xenophilius doesn’t actually know what the symbol means., The Lovegoods are quite . . . unusual. He could easily have picked it up somewhere and think it’s a cross section of the head of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack or something. Well, I don’t know what they are, but apparently he and his daughter go on holiday looking for them. . . . That’s her, Probably trying to get rid of a Wrackspurt, Gregorovitch! He’s a wandmaker! He made your wand! That’s why I thought — Quidditch — I . . . I read it somewhere, I think, In a — a fan magazine, So . . . er . . . where is Gregorovitch these days? May I sit down? Mr. Doge, I’m Harry Potter. I saw the obituary you wrote for the Daily Prophet, I didn’t realize you knew Professor Dumbledore so well. Speaking of the Daily Prophet . . . I don’t know whether you saw, Mr. Doge — ? Elphias, I don’t know whether you saw the interview Rita Skeeter gave about Dumbledore? well Rita Skeeter hinted that Professor Dumbledore was involved in the Dark Arts when he was young. What do you mean? Who said his sister was a Squib? I thought she was ill? He never told me his sister was a Squib, ’ What is this? Bathilda Bagshot? The author of A History of Magic? Bathilda Bagshot lives in Godric’s Hollow? Why didn’t I make sure I had the Invisibility Cloak with me? When you say you’ve got the Cloak, and clothes . . . How the ruddy hell — ? When did you do all this? The others — everyone at the wedding — Yeah. Stupefy! I should’ve recognized him, he was there the night Dumbledore died, Lock the door, and Ron, turn out the lights. We just need to wipe their memories, It’s better like that, it’ll throw them off the scent. If we killed them it’d be obvious we were here. Brilliant! Take care of the other one and the waitress while Ron and I clear up. Don’t you think they might wonder what’s happened if they wake up and find themselves in a place that looks like it’s just been bombed? If I can’t use magic, and you can’t use magic near me, without us giving away our position —he began Grimmauld Place, Ron’s dad said they’ve put up jinxes against him — and even if they haven’t worked, so what? I swear, I’d like nothing better than to meet Snape! Hermione, where else is there? It’s the best chance we’ve got. Snape’s only one Death Eater. If I’ve still got the Trace on me, we’ll have whole crowds of them on us wherever else we go. So where are these jinxes they put up against Snape? Well, we can’t stay here forever, We’re not Snape! No! No! It wasn’t us! We didn’t kill you — And Grimmauld Place is out if Snape can get in there. . . . I suppose we could try my parents’ house, though I think there’s a chance they might check there. . . . Oh, I wish they’d shut up! Yeah, but it wasn’t really him, was it? Just something to scare Snape. No, I just felt anger — he’s really angry — No, I just felt anger — I couldn’t tell — It did, for a while, I — I think it’s started opening again whenever he loses control, that’s how it used to — Yeah, I do remember, thanks, It’s not a problem, It’s your family, ’course you’re worried. I’d feel the same way. I do feel the same way. Bathroom, More, Rowle, or shall we end it and feed you to Nagini? Lord Voldemort is not sure that he will forgive this time. . . . You called me back for this, to tell me that Harry Potter has escaped again? Draco, give Rowle another taste of our displeasure . . . Do it, or feel my wrath yourself! Thank you, Hermione, Come back up here. R.A.B. I think I’ve found him. He was a Death Eater, Sirius told me about him, he joined up when he was really young and then got cold feet and tried to leave — so they killed him. Let’s find out, He played Seeker, He’s sitting in the middle of the front row, that’s where the Seeker . . . Never mind, Like Voldemort put on the stone basin in the cave, Why did you come up here anyway? What have you been doing? Kreacher nicked loads of things back from us, He had a whole stash of stuff in his cupboard in the kitchen. C’mon. It’s not over yet, Kreacher! I forbid you to call anyone ‘blood traitor’ or ‘Mudblood,’ I’ve got a question for you, and I order you to answer it truthfully. Understand? Two years ago, there was a big gold locket in the drawing room upstairs. We threw it out. Did you steal it back? Where is it now? Gone? What do you mean, it’s gone? Kreacher, Kreacher, Kreacher, I don’t think so. Right, Kreacher, I want the truth: How do you know Mundungus Fletcher stole the locket? What? Why? Where did it come from? What did Regulus have to do with it? Kreacher, sit up and tell me everything you know about that locket, and everything Regulus had to do with it! Voldemort needed an elf? How did you get away? I know — but how did you escape the Inferi? I know, but — But . . . you couldn’t Apparate in and out of that cave, What? What did Regulus say when you told him what had happened? And he made you drink the potion? I told you not to call her ‘Mudblood’! Kreacher — stop, stop! Well then, And you tried to destroy it? Kreacher, Voldemort tried to kill you, Regulus died to bring Voldemort down, but you were still happy to betray Sirius to Voldemort? You were happy to go to Narcissa and Bellatrix, and pass information to Voldemort through them. . . . Kreacher, when you feel up to it, er . . . please sit up. Kreacher, Kreacher, We need to find out where the locket — where Master Regulus’s locket is. It’s really important. And bring him here, to Grimmauld Place, Do you think you could do that for us? How do they — ? began Harry. Don’t move! Show yourself! Oh, all right, but I had to check, didn’t I? No, What’s going on? Is everyone okay? We know — No, only after we ran into a couple of Death Eaters in a café on Tottenham Court Road. And it doesn’t seem likely they were just strolling down Tottenham Court Road at the time, does it? Tell us what happened after we left, we haven’t heard a thing since Ron’s dad told us the family were safe. The Death Eaters got through all those protective charms? And this dramatic change in Ministry policy, involves warning the Wizarding world against me instead of Voldemort? It’s . . . it’s . . . he muttered, struggling to find words that did justice to the horror of his thoughts, but Lupin said quietly,I know It’s . . . it’s . . . he muttered, struggling to find words that did justice to the horror of his thoughts, but Lupin said quietly,I know He did, and Ron and Hermione are in on it and they’re coming with me. I can’t, Remus, I’m sorry. If Dumbledore didn’t tell you I don’t think I can. Congratulations, Just — just to be clear, You want to leave Tonks at her parents’ house and come away with us? Well, Explain, then, I see, so you’re just going to dump her and the kid and run off with us? Oh, I don’t know, Hermione, I’d be pretty ashamed of him. If the new regime thinks Muggle-borns are bad, what will they do to a half-werewolf whose father’s in the Order? My father died trying to protect my mother and me, and you reckon he’d tell you to abandon your kid to go on an adventure with us? I think you’re feeling a bit of a daredevil, I’d never have believed this, The man who taught me to fight dementors — a coward. It was easy, Don’t look at me like that! he snapped at Hermione. He had it coming to him, Parents, shouldn’t leave their kids unless — unless they’ve got to. I know I shouldn’t have called him a coward. But he’s acting like one. I know, But if it makes him go back to Tonks, it’ll be worth it, won’t it? You’re not in much of a position to make threats, You’ve done really well, Kreacher, Right, we’ve got a few questions for you, We’re not interested in why you ran out on Mad-Eye, We already knew you were an unreliable bit of scum. It’s not about the goblets either, although you’re getting warmer, Shut up and listen. When you cleaned out this house of anything valuable, Harry began, Kreacher, no! We need him conscious, Kreacher, but if he needs persuading you can do the honors, When you stripped this house of all the valuables you could find, you took a bunch of stuff from the kitchen cupboard. There was a locket there. What did you do with it? Who was this woman? I’ve got news, and you won’t like it. Death Eaters, There are pictures of them inside. They were at the top of the tower when Snape killed Dumbledore, so it’s all friends together. And, I can’t see that the other teachers have got any choice but to stay. If the Ministry and Voldemort are behind Snape it’ll be a choice between staying and teaching, or a nice few years in Azkaban — and that’s if they’re lucky. I reckon they’ll stay to try and protect the students. Thanks, Kreacher, Well, at least we know exactly where Snape is now. There are still a load of Death Eaters watching the house, more than usual. It’s like they’re hoping we’ll march out carrying our school trunks and head off for the Hogwarts Express. They nearly saw me coming back in just now, I landed badly on the top step, and the Cloak slipped. Watched the Ministry entrance for seven hours. No sign of her. Saw your dad, though, Ron. He looks fine. I think we should do it tomorrow, I am, I don’t think we’re going to be much better prepared than we are now even if we skulk around the Ministry entrance for another month. The longer we put it off, the farther away that locket could be. There’s already a good chance Umbridge has chucked it away; the thing doesn’t open. Wouldn’t make any difference to her, she was so evil in the first place, We know everything important, We know they’ve stopped Apparition in and out of the Ministry. We know only the most senior Ministry members are allowed to connect their homes to the Floo Network now, because Ron heard those two Unspeakables complaining about it. And we know roughly where Umbridge’s office is, because of what you heard that bearded bloke saying to his mate — Exactly, And we know you get in using those funny coins, or tokens, or whatever they are, because I saw that witch borrowing one from her friend — If the plan works, we will have, That’ll be true even if we spend another three months preparing, It’s time to act. All right, Let me know if you ever defeat Voldemort, won’t you? Thanks, Kreacher, Not for long, We’re running late, Mr. Magical Maintenance will be here any second. Looks like it, We’ll come with you, we should stick together — Yes, of course, Needed Needed a quick word with Arthur Weasley Someone said he was up on level one. No, No, nothing like that. Good day, Minister. Ron, it’s me, Harry! Harry! She had to go down to the courtrooms with Umbridge, she couldn’t refuse, and — Sorry? I — so what if I did? Arthur, you know you’re being tracked, don’t you? No, it’s a fact! They’re watching your every move — I’m behind you, Stupefy! Stupefy! Hermione, if you think I was going to sit here and let her pretend — EXPECTO PATRONUM! Get the Horcrux, Did I? Well, I’ve had a change of heart. Diffindo! Hermione, how do I get rid of these chains? Hermione, we’re surrounded by dementors! You’re going to leave here with us, Go home, grab your children, and get out, get out of the country if you’ve got to.Disguise yourselves and run.  You’ve seen how it is, you won’t get anything like a fair hearing here. Patronuses, As many as we can muster; do yours, Hermione. It’s the only spell she ever has trouble with, Bit unfortunate, really . . . Come on, Hermione. . . . Take him away, It’s been decided that you should all go home and go into hiding with your families, Go abroad if you can. Just get well away from the Ministry. That’s the — er — new official position. Now, if you’ll just follow the Patronuses, you’ll be able to leave from the Atrium. We won’t be if we move fast, Who’s got wands? Okay, all of you who haven’t got wands need to attach yourself to somebody who has. We’ll need to be fast before they stop us. Come on. STOP! Follow me, This lot need to leave before you seal the exits, Are you contradicting me? Would you like me to have your family tree examined, like I had Dirk Cresswell’s? Their blood is pure, Purer than many of yours, I daresay. Off you go, He’s been helping Muggle-borns escape, Yaxley! Come on! Harry shouted at Hermione; he seized her hand and they jumped into the fireplace together as Yaxley’s curse sailed over Harry’s head. They spun for a few seconds before shooting up out of a toilet into a cubicle. LET’S GO! What’s happened to him? Bag — right — Accio Dittany! Wow, How did he get hurt? I mean why are we here? I thought we were going back to Grimmauld Place? What d’you — ? But then, where’s he? Hang on. . . . You don’t mean he’s at Grimmauld Place? He can’t get in there? Don’t be stupid, it wasn’t your fault! If anything, it was mine. . . . Umbridge had stuck it to her office door, to spy on people. I couldn’t leave it there . . . but that’s how they knew there were intruders. — the first place you thought of, I dunno. Let’s stay here for now, Tent? In the . . . of course, I thought this belonged to that bloke Perkins at the Ministry? Dumbledore said fear of a name — began Harry. Respect? So, have you got it? What did we just go through all that for? The locket! Where’s the locket? I reckon Kreacher’s right, We’re going to have to work out how to open this thing before we can destroy it. What d’you mean? Keep it safe till we work out how to destroy it, Dream, Must’ve dozed off, sorry. I didn’t mean it to happen! It was a dream! Can you control what you dream about, Hermione? He’s found Gregorovitch, Hermione, and I think he’s killed him, but before he killed him he read Gregorovitch’s mind and I saw — I can finish the watch! He found Gregorovitch. He had him tied up, he was torturing him. I dunno. . . . It’s weird, isn’t it? He wanted something from Gregorovitch, He asked him to hand it over, but Gregorovitch said it had been stolen from him . . . and then . . . then . . . He read Gregorovitch’s mind, and I saw this young bloke perched on a windowsill, and he fired a curse at Gregorovitch and jumped out of sight. He stole it, he stole whatever You-Know-Who’s after.  And I . . .I think I’ve seen him somewhere. . . . No . . . it must’ve been something small. I don’t know, Didn’t Hermione say he had pushed his soul to the limit already? Yeah . . . maybe, I couldn’t . . . make one, Wouldn’t . . . come. I don’t know. You go and fight your way through the dementors, then, That’s convenient. Yeah, loads better! What? No! I remember everything we’ve done while I’ve been wearing it. I wouldn’t know what I’d done if I’d been possessed, would I? Ginny told me there were times when she couldn’t remember anything. We are not leaving that Horcrux lying around, If we lose it, if it gets stolen — Not if I left some money under the chicken coop? I can’t see him hiding anything at Borgin and Burkes, Borgin and Burke were experts at Dark objects, they would’ve recognized a Horcrux straightaway. I still reckon he might have hidden something at Hogwarts. Dumbledore said in front of me that he never assumed he knew all of Hogwarts’s secrets. I’m telling you, if there was one place Vol — YOU-KNOW-WHO, then! If there was one place that was really important to You-Know-Who, it was Hogwarts! Yeah, his school! It was his first real home, the place that meant he was special; it meant everything to him, and even after he left — That’s right, Yeah, Okay, then, Forget Hogwarts. He wouldn’t have hidden a Horcrux here, A face, The same face. The thief who stole from Gregorovitch. Shut up! Shut up now! Hermione, be quiet, I can hear someone! You cast the Muffliato charm over us, right? Harry, who had found the need to remain silent increasingly difficult the longer they eavesdropped, now found himself unable to say more than, Ginny — the sword — Unless he was asleep, said Harry, but he still held his breath as Hermione knelt down in front of the empty canvas, her wand directed at its center, cleared her throat, then said:“Er — Phineas? Phineas Nigellus?” Never mind where we are, Maybe, We’ve got a couple of questions to ask you — about the sword of Gryffindor. They weren’t thieving, That sword isn’t Snape’s. Never mind that! How did Snape punish Ginny, Neville, and Luna? And Snape might’ve thought that was a punishment, but Ginny, Neville, and Luna probably had a good laugh with Hagrid. The Forbidden Forest . . . they’ve faced plenty worse than the Forbidden Forest, big deal! Don’t call Hermione simple, Dumbledore! Can’t you bring us Dumbledore? Professor Dumbledore’s portrait — couldn’t you bring him along, here, into yours? Wait! Have you told Snape you saw this? I know! And Dumbledore didn’t give it to me because he still needed it, he wanted to use it on the locket — — and put a fake in the glass case — Not at Hogwarts, The Shrieking Shack? Nobody ever goes in there. Dumbledore trusted Snape, Ah, So, would he have hidden the sword well away from Hogsmeade, then? What d’you reckon, Ron? Ron? What? What did you see? What do you mean? What’s the problem? Problem? Come on, Spit it out, will you? I don’t know? I don’t know? I thought you knew what you’d signed up for, So what part of it isn’t living up to your expectations? Did you think we’d be staying in five-star hotels? Finding a Horcrux every other day? Did you think you’d be back to Mummy by Christmas? Well, sorry to let you down, I’ve been straight with you from the start, I told you everything Dumbledore told me. And in case you haven’t noticed, we’ve found one Horcrux — Yeah, he would, D’you think I haven’t noticed the two of you whispering behind my back? D’you think I didn’t guess you were thinking this stuff? So why are you still here? Go home then, I was only saying — she was with the others, they were with Hagrid — Yeah, I — My parents are dead! Then GO! Go back to them, pretend you’ve got over your spattergroit and Mummy’ll be able to feed you up and — Leave the Horcrux, Hermione? Hermione, I’ve been thinking, and — I never took Ancient Runes, Hermione. No . . . No, wait a moment. Isn’t it the same symbol Luna’s dad was wearing round his neck? Then it’s Grindelwald’s mark. Krum told me . . . Well, like I say, Krum reckoned that symbol was carved on a wall at Durmstrang, and Grindelwald put it there. Yeah, it is weird, And you’d think Scrimgeour would have recognized it. He was Minister, he ought to have been expert on Dark stuff. Hermione? I’ve been thinking. I — I want to go to Godric’s Hollow. Did you hear me right? Er — what’s there? Really? Gryffindor came from Godric’s Hollow? Erm, I might’ve opened it, you know, when I bought it . . . just the once. . . . Oh yeah . . . Remember what Muriel said? You know, Ginny’s great-aunt. At the wedding. The one who said you had skinny ankles. It was a sticky moment: Harry knew that she had sensed Ron’s name in the offing. He rushed on:She said Bathilda Bagshot still lives in Godric’s Hollow. What? What did you do that for? I thought you’d seen a Death Eater unzipping the tent, at least — Yes, So, are we going to go to Godric’s Hollow? Let’s take off the Cloak, Oh, come on, we don’t look like us and there’s no one around. Really? C’mon, Look at this, it’s an Abbott, could be some long-lost relation of Hannah’s! Is it — ? No, let’s keep looking, What? Yeah . . . it could be. . . . I’m going to keep looking for my parents, all right? ‘The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death’ . . . ‘The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death’ . . . Isn’t that a Death Eater idea? Why is that there? What’s wrong? Are you sure? We look like Muggles, It’s a cat, But let’s get out of here, and we can put the Cloak back on. Look. . . . Look at it, Hermione. . . . Maybe you can’t rebuild it? Maybe it’s like the injuries from Dark Magic and you can’t repair the damage? It’s brilliant. I’m glad they did. I . . . Are you Bathilda? Bathilda? Look at the size of her; I think we could overpower her if we had to, Listen, I should have told you, I knew she wasn’t all there. Muriel called her ‘gaga. ’ It’s okay, Let me do that, The dust vanished from the photographs, and he saw at once that half a dozen were missing from the largest and most ornate frames. He wondered whether Bathilda or somebody else had removed them. Mrs. — Miss — Bagshot? Who is this? Miss Bagshot? Who is this person? Do you know who this is? This man? Do you know him? What’s he called? Who is this person? This picture, Hermione, it’s the thief, the thief who stole from Gregorovitch! Please! Who is this? You want us to leave? Oh, right . . . Hermione, I think she wants me to go upstairs with her. She wants me to go with her, alone. Maybe Dumbledore told her to give the sword to me, and only to me? Yes, I think she does. Lead the way, Lumos, Yes, I am. Have you got anything for me? Have you got anything for me? Have you got anything for me? Have you got anything for me? Have you got anything for me? Have you got anything for me? What is it? No! Accio . . . Accio Wand . . . He’s coming! Hermione, he’s coming! Nice costume, mister! Yes, We got away. How long ago did we leave? And I’ve been . . . what, unconscious? Where’ve you put the Horcrux? We shouldn’t have gone to Godric’s Hollow. It’s my fault, it’s all my fault, Hermione, I’m sorry. Yeah, well . . . we got that wrong, didn’t we? No, She was the snake . . . or the snake was her . . . Bathilda must’ve been dead a while. The snake was . . . was inside her. You-Know-Who put it there in Godric’s Hollow, to wait. You were right. He knew I’d go back. Lupin said there would be magic we’d never imagined, Once we were up in the room, the snake sent a message to You-Know-Who, I heard it happen inside my head, I felt him get excited, he said to keep me there . . . and then . . . . . . she changed, changed into the snake, and attacked. It wasn’t supposed to kill me, just keep me there till You-Know-Who came. You’re the one who needs sleep. No offense, but you look terrible. I’m fine. I’ll keep watch for a while. Where’s my wand? Where’s my wand, Hermione? Where’s my wand? Mend it. Please. Please, Hermione, try! Lumos! Expelliarmus! It was an accident, We’ll — we’ll find a way to repair it. All right, well, I’ll just borrow yours for now, then. While I keep watch. Thanks, No, Where — how — ? No, she probably wasn’t. No, You were trying to get us out of there alive, and you were incredible. I’d be dead if you hadn’t been there to help me. Yeah, you could say that — You did read that letter to Grindelwald, didn’t you? What’s Nurmengard? I thought you’d say that, I thought you’d say ‘They were young. ’ They were the same age as we are now. And here we are, risking our lives to fight the Dark Arts, and there he was, in a huddle with his new best friend, plotting their rise to power over the Muggles. Alone? He wasn’t alone! He had his brother and sister for company, his Squib sister he was keeping locked up — The Dumbledore we thought we knew didn’t want to conquer Muggles by force! Maybe I am! Look what he asked from me, Hermione! Risk your life, Harry! And again! And again! And don’t expect me to explain everything, just trust me blindly, trust that I know what I’m doing, trust me even though I don’t trust you! Never the whole truth! Never! I don’t know who he loved, Hermione, but it was never me. This isn’t love, the mess he’s left me in. He shared a damn sight more of what he was really thinking with Gellert Grindelwald than he ever shared with me. Thanks for the tea. I’ll finish the watch. You get back in the warm. Where are we? It was y-you? Y-you cast that doe? My Patronus is a stag. How come you’re here? Yeah, But I don’t understand.How did you get here?  How did you find us? You didn’t see anyone else? No Whoever cast the Patronus must have put it there. One way to find out, isn’t there? Come here, No, you should do it. Because you got the sword out of the pool. I think it’s supposed to be you. I’m going to open it, and you stab it. Straightaway, okay? Because whatever’s in there will put up a fight. The bit of Riddle in the diary tried to kill me. I’m going to ask it to open, using Parseltongue, What? Let’s get rid of the damn thing, it’s been months — What? You can do it, you can! You’ve just got the sword, I know it’s supposed to be you who uses it. Please, just get rid of it, Ron. On three, One . . . two . . . three . . . open. Stab, Don’t listen to it! Stab it! Stab! Stab it! Stab! Ron, stab it now! Ron, stab it, STAB IT! Ron! Ron — ? After you left, she cried for a week. Probably longer, only she didn’t want me to see. There were loads of nights when we never even spoke to each other. With you gone . . . She’s like my sister, I love her like a sister and I reckon she feels the same way about me. It’s always been like that. I thought you knew. You’ve sort of made up for it tonight, Getting the sword. Finishing off the Horcrux. Saving my life. Stuff like that always sounds cooler than it really was, I’ve been trying to tell you that for years. And now, all we’ve got to do is find the tent again. Hermione! It’s okay, everything’s fine. More than fine. I’m great. There’s someone here. Protego! Hermione! Hermione, will you please — Hermione, What? What did you say to them? And they believed that? Hermione, Ron just saved my life. What? What are you, compared with the Boy Who Lived? We were there, We spent two nights there, and the second night I kept thinking I could hear someone moving around in the dark and calling out! — and Ron stabbed it with the sword. Well, it — it screamed, Here. Did you just say you got away from the Snatchers with a spare wand? You were right, Mine’s broken. About the best you could hope for, I think, The what? Yes Because we used his name? You’re kidding? His Patronus is a lynx, we saw it at the wedding, remember? Dumbledore what? Dumbledore’s dead, He’s definitely gone. Anyway, his Patronus was a phoenix, not a doe. Yeah, but if Dumbledore was alive, why wouldn’t he show himself? Why wouldn’t he just hand us the sword? Which is what? No, He must’ve known you’d always want to come back. Speaking of Dumbledore, have you heard what Skeeter wrote about him? Engorgio. Sorry — Reducio. The what? Er — why? What do you want? Sorry? Er — why? Hermione, we don’t need another Godric’s Hollow. We talked ourselves into going there, and — Here we go again! But don’t you think if it was, Dumbledore would have told me about it before he died? Fine, Only, once we’ve seen Lovegood, let’s try and look for some more Horcruxes, shall we? Where do the Lovegoods live, anyway? Do either of you know? You only agreed to try and get back in her good books. Hello, Mr. Lovegood, I’m Harry, Harry Potter. Would it be okay if we came in? There’s something we’d like to ask you. It won’t take long, Sorry? Hermione, We need some help, He’s probably worried about what’ll happen to them if the Death Eaters find out I was here, Look at this, The Deathly Hallows? I’m sorry, I still don’t really understand. No, No, Yeah, because we really need a bit more fear in our lives, Go on, Hermione. I’m sorry, but Death spoke to them? Right, sorry. Go on. Death’s got an Invisibility Cloak? So the Elder Wand, you think that exists too? Which is what? Mr. Lovegood, Where’s Luna? Where’s Luna? Where’s Luna? Where’s Luna? I don’t think Luna’s been here for weeks, Her clothes are gone, her bed hasn’t been slept in. Where is she? And why do you keep looking out of the window? Mr. Lovegood, Is that what you were doing when you went into the garden, Mr. Lovegood? Sending an owl to the Ministry? Don’t make us hurt you, Get out of the way, Mr. Lovegood. Come on, we’ve got to get out of here. Yeah, you are, Hermione, I don’t know what we’d do without you. She will, She’s tough, Luna, much tougher than you’d think. She’s probably teaching all the inmates about Wrackspurts and Nargles. I don’t know. We could do with an unbeatable wand, You said there have been loads of wands — the Deathstick and whatever they were called — When my wand connected with You-Know-Who’s, it made my mum and dad appear . . . and Cedric . . . But she, the girl in the tale, didn’t really come back, did she? The story says that once people are dead, they belong with the dead. But the second brother still got to see her and talk to her, didn’t he? He even lived with her for a while. . . . So that Peverell bloke who’s buried in Godric’s Hollow, you don’t know anything about him, then? Marvolo Gaunt! Marvolo Gaunt! Marvolo Gaunt! Marvolo Gaunt! You-Know-Who’s grandfather! In the Pensieve! With Dumbledore! Marvolo Gaunt said he was descended from the Peverells! The ring, the ring that became the Horcrux, Marvolo Gaunt said it had the Peverell coat of arms on it! I saw him waving it in the bloke from the Ministry’s face, he nearly shoved it up his nose! Not really, There was nothing fancy on there, as far as I could see; maybe a few scratches. I only ever saw it really close up after it had been cracked open. Why not? Marvolo Gaunt was an ignorant old git who lived like a pig, all he cared about was his ancestry. If that ring had been passed down through the centuries, he might not have known what it really was. There were no books in that house, and trust me, he wasn’t the type to read fairy tales to his kids. Well, why not? Why not? It was a stone, wasn’t it? What if it was the Resurrection Stone? Fit everything in? Hermione, it fits of its own accord! I know the sign of the Deathly Hallows was on that stone! Gaunt said he was descended from the Peverells! Dumbledore had my Cloak the night my parents died! My mum told Sirius that Dumbledore borrowed the Cloak! This is why! He wanted to examine it, because he thought it was the third Hallow! Ignotus Peverell is buried in Godric’s Hollow. . . . He’s my ancestor! I’m descended from the third brother! It all makes sense! Read it, Read it! Dumbledore had the Cloak, Hermione! Why else would he want it? He didn’t need a Cloak, he could perform a Disillusionment Charm so powerful that he made himself completely invisible without one! IT’S IN HERE! He left me the ring — it’s in the Snitch! That’s what he’s after. You-Know-Who’s after the Elder Wand. This is it, This explains everything. The Deathly Hallows are real, and I’ve got one — maybe two — — and You-Know-Who’s chasing the third, but he doesn’t realize . . . he just thinks it’s a powerful wand — But don’t you see? It all fits — But you said it, Hermione! You’ve got to find out about them for yourself! It’s a Quest! Dumbledore usually let me find out stuff for myself. He let me try my strength, take risks. This feels like the kind of thing he’d do. You don’t believe in this, do you? Sorry? No — is it George? Brilliant, But did you hear what Fred said? He’s abroad! He’s still looking for the Wand, I knew it! Come on, Hermione, why are you so determined not to admit it? Vol — — demort’s after the Elder Wand! Stung, Been stung. Dudley, Dudley, I — Vernon. Vernon Dudley. Anyone still got a wand? This is all my fault. I said the name, I’m sorry — Dean? Slytherin, Good for you, Vernon, ’cause there ain’t a lot of Mudblood Slytherins. It’s in the dungeons, You enter through the wall. It’s full of skulls and stuff and it’s under the lake, so the light’s all green. He works at the Ministry, Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes. But, It’s my father’s, Don’t touch it! Be quiet! Shut up, Ron, we need to work out a way — We need a plan, stop yelling — we need to get these ropes off — Luna? Luna, can you help us get these ropes off? There! Help us! We’re in the cellar of Malfoy Manor, help us! Griphook, you must tell them that sword’s a fake, they mustn’t know it’s the real one, Griphook, please — But how did you — ? You can Disapparate out of this cellar? And you can take humans with you? And then come back, Can you do that, Dobby? Go, both of you! We’ll see you at Bill and Fleur’s. Go! Go! We’ll follow, just go! We’re going to have to try and tackle him, Leave the lights on, You’re going to kill me? After I saved your life? You owe me, Wormtail! No — Stupefy! All right! Stupefy! Ron, catch — and GO! Are you all right? he said as the goblin stirred, but Griphook merely whimpered. Dobby, is this Shell Cottage? Have we come to the right place? Dobby? Dobby! No — HELP! No, Dobby . . . Dobby . . . Hermione? Where is she? I want to do it properly, Not by magic. Have you got a spade? How’s Hermione? Good-bye, Dobby, D’you mind if I stay here a moment? How are they protected? No, I need both of them here. I need to talk to them. It’s important. I’m going to wash, Then I’ll need to see them, straightaway. I need to speak to Griphook and Ollivander, I’m sorry, but it can’t wait. I need to talk to them now. Privately — and separately. It’s urgent. We can’t tell you what we’re doing, You’re in the Order, Bill, you know Dumbledore left us a mission. We’re not supposed to talk about it to anyone else. Griphook, I’ll speak to Griphook first. I need you two as well! You’ll see. Come on. I’m sorry, How are your legs? You probably don’t remember — Harry began. Yes, In what way? So? Griphook, What did she think we’d seen, what else did she think we might have taken? The — the what? Well, I take it you’re not sorry? Griphook, Well, I need some help, Griphook, and you can give it to me. I need to break into a Gringotts vault. Yeah, The same day I first met you, Griphook. My birthday, seven years ago. Well, the vault we need to get into isn’t empty, and I’m guessing its protection will be pretty powerful, It belongs to the Lestranges. Yeah, But I’m not trying to get myself any treasure, I’m not trying to take anything for personal gain. Can you believe that? Wand-carriers, It doesn’t matter, But the fake sword isn’t the only thing in that vault, is it? Perhaps you’ve seen the other things in there? Will you help us? We haven’t got a hope of breaking in without a goblin’s help. You’re our one chance. Thank you, Yeah, of course, What? Bellatrix was terrified when she thought we’d been in there, she was beside herself. Why? Something she was petrified You-Know-Who would find out about. I don’t know whether he was ever inside Gringotts, He never had gold there when he was younger, because nobody left him anything. He would have seen the bank from the outside, though, the first time he ever went to Diagon Alley. I think he would have envied anyone who had a key to a Gringotts vault. I think he’d have seen it as a real symbol of belonging to the Wizarding world. And don’t forget, he trusted Bellatrix and her husband. They were his most devoted servants before he fell, and they went looking for him after he vanished. He said it the night he came back, I heard him. I don’t think he’d have told Bellatrix it was a Horcrux, though. He never told Lucius Malfoy the truth about the diary. He probably told her it was a treasured possession and asked her to place it in her vault. The safest place in the world for anything you want to hide, Hagrid told me . . . except for Hogwarts. Bits of him, Bits . . . I just wish I’d understood Dumbledore as much. But we’ll see. Come on — Ollivander now. I’m sorry, We were glad to do it. Mr. Ollivander, I need some help. Can you mend this? Is it possible? Yeah, Can you — ? Can you identify these? And this one? Was? Isn’t it still his? — I did — You talk about wands like they’ve got feelings, like they can think for themselves. A person can still use a wand that hasn’t chosen them, though? I took this wand from Draco Malfoy by force, Can I use it safely? And this holds true for all wands, does it? So, it isn’t necessary to kill the previous owner to take true possession of a wand? There are legends, though, Legends about a wand — or wands — that have passed from hand to hand by murder. And You-Know-Who is interested in it, isn’t he? He wanted you to tell him how to overcome the connection between our wands, I understand, You told him about the twin cores? You said he just had to borrow another wizard’s wand? But it didn’t work, Mine still beat the borrowed wand. Do you know why that is? We were talking about the other wand, the wand that changes hands by murder. When You-Know-Who realized my wand had done something strange, he came back and asked about that other wand, didn’t he? But he’ll know soon, if he doesn’t already, that mine’s broken beyond repair, Priori Incantatem, We left your wand and the blackthorn wand at the Malfoys’, Hermione. If they examine them properly, make them re-create the spells they’ve cast lately, they’ll see that yours broke mine, they’ll see that you tried and failed to mend it, and they’ll realize that I’ve been using the blackthorn one ever since. And will it? Mr. Ollivander, you told You-Know-Who that Gregorovitch had the Elder Wand, didn’t you? Never mind how I know it, You told You-Know-Who that Gregorovitch had the wand? What? Mr. Ollivander, one last thing, and then we’ll let you get some rest. What do you know about the Deathly Hallows? The Deathly Hallows. Thank you, Thank you very much. We’ll leave you to get some rest now. I do, I really do. Please get some rest. Thank you for telling me all of this. Gregorovitch had the Elder Wand a long time ago, I saw You-Know-Who trying to find him. When he tracked him down, he found that Gregorovitch didn’t have it anymore:It was stolen from him by Grindelwald. How Grindelwald found out that Gregorovitch had it, I don’t know — but if Gregorovitch was stupid enough to spread the rumor, it can’t have been that difficult. And Grindelwald used the Elder Wand to become powerful. And at the height of his power, when Dumbledore knew he was the only one who could stop him, he dueled Grindelwald and beat him, and he took the Elder Wand. At Hogwarts, It’s too late for that, He knows where it is. He’s there now. No, Hermione’s right. Dumbledore didn’t want me to have it. He didn’t want me to take it. He wanted me to get the Horcruxes. I’m not supposed to . . . I’m supposed to get the Horcruxes. . . . That’s great! Griphook, thank you, we’re really — How much do you want? I’ve got gold. You can’t have that, I’m sorry. We need to discuss this, Griphook Could you give us a few minutes? It is true? Was the sword stolen by Gryffindor? Maybe he’s lying,Griphook Maybe Gryffindor didn’t take the sword. How do we know the goblin version of history’s right? Changes how I feel about it, said Griphook. He can have it, after we’ve used it on all of the Horcruxes. I’ll make sure he gets it then. I’ll keep my word. I know that, but he needn’t. I won’t be lying . . . really. Nor do I, much, Yes, That’ll be enough, said Harry, who was examining Griphook’s hand-drawn map of the deepest passageways. I’m sorry, I never meant you to have to deal with all of this. We don’t mind sleeping in the living room, Don’t worry about us. We’ll be off your hands soon too, Ron, Hermione, and I. We won’t need to be here much longer. M-me? I — yeah — blimey — I’m sorry, Sorry, Bill. What d’you mean, ‘gone on’? I respect — Harry began, but Bill shook his head. But if it was bought — Right, I’ll bear that in mind. And you’ll be using her actual wand, so I reckon you’ll be pretty convincing. We’ve just been checking the last-minute stuff, Griphook. We’ve told Bill and Fleur we’re leaving tomorrow, and we’ve told them not to get up to see us off. Well, he’s not my type, but he’ll do, Shall we go, then? Too polite, You need to treat people like they’re scum! Imperio! Imperio! We’re in trouble; they suspect, I don’t think I did it strongly enough, I don’t know. . . . Let’s go. Imperio! Hide, It washes away all enchantment, all magical concealment! They know there are impostors in Gringotts, they have set off defenses against us! Imperio! Good thinking, Lead the way, Griphook! Let’s worry about that when we have to, Griphook, how much farther? Search, fast! Lumos! Okay, don’t touch anything! Just look around! Remember, the cup’s small and gold, it’s got a badger engraved on it, two handles — otherwise see if you can spot Ravenclaw’s symbol anywhere, the eagle — It’s there, it’s up there! Then what do we do? If you want the sword, Griphook, then you’ll have to help us more than — wait! Can I touch stuff with the sword? Hermione, give it here! If I can just poke the sword through a handle — but how am I going to get up there? Hermione, I’ve got to get up there, we’ve got to get rid of it — Liberacorpus! Get it! Where’s the sword? It had the cup on it! Stupefy! Relashio! This way! Get up, climb up, come on — No idea, I say we jump when it gets low enough! Straight into the water before it realizes we’re here! NOW! I say we jump when it gets low enough! — no sword, No sword, He knows. I saw him find out about the cup, I — I was in his head, he’s he’s seriously angry, and scared too, he can’t understand how we knew, and now he’s going to check the others are safe, the ring first. No, he was concentrating on warning Snape, he didn’t think about exactly where it is — What? Can you imagine what he’s going to do once he realizes the ring and the locket are gone? What if he moves the Hogwarts Horcrux, decides it isn’t safe enough? We’ll go to Hogsmeade, and try to work something out once we see what the protection around the school’s like. Get under the Cloak, Hermione, I want to stick together this time. It’ll be dark, no one’s going to notice our feet. They were ready for us, They set up that spell to tell them we’d come. I reckon they’ve done something to keep us here, trap us — It was of Ron and Hermione that he thought as he whispered, Expecto Patronum! Thank you, We can’t thank you enough. You saved our lives. You sent Dobby. He’s dead, Bellatrix Lestrange killed him. You’re Aberforth, How did you get this? Elphias Doge mentioned her to us, He was never free, Never, The night that your brother died, he drank a potion that drove him out of his mind. He started screaming, pleading with someone who wasn’t there. ‘Don’t hurt them, please . . . hurt me instead. He thought he was back there with you and Grindelwald, I know he did, He thought he was watching Grindelwald hurting you and Ariana. . . . It was torture to him, if you’d seen him then, you wouldn’t say he was free. Because, sometimes you’ve got to think about more than your own safety! Sometimes you’ve got to think about the greater good! This is war! I’m of age, and I’m going to keep fighting even if you’ve given up! ‘You-Know-Who’s won, it’s over, and anyone who’s pretending different’s kidding themselves. No, it isn’t, Your brother knew how to finish You-Know-Who and he passed the knowledge on to me. I’m going to keep going until I succeed — or I die. Don’t think I don’t know how this might end. I’ve known it for years. We need to get into Hogwarts, If you can’t help us, we’ll wait till daybreak, leave you in peace, and try to find a way in ourselves. If you can help us — well, now would be a great time to mention it. Neville — what the — how — ? Neville, what’s happened to you? Harry addressed Aberforth.I don’t know how to thank you. You’ve saved our lives twice. Yeah, it’s true, You’re right, but tell us about Hogwarts, Neville, we haven’t heard anything. Those two Death Eaters who teach here? Like Umbridge? Neville, she’s all right, we’ve seen her — You used to? Where are we? And the Carrows can’t get in? No, We need to get going, Plan? We haven’t come back to stay, I — I can’t tell you. Well, yeah — You don’t understand. We — we can’t tell you. We’ve got to do it — alone. Because . . . Dumbledore left the three of us a job, and we weren’t supposed to tell — I mean, he wanted us to do it, just the three of us. Look, What? what are you doing here? How did you — ? Listen, I’m sorry, but that’s not what we came back for. There’s something we’ve got to do, and then — There isn’t one, What? What did you call them all back for? This is insane — What? All right, Okay, There’s something we need to find, Something — something that’ll help us overthrow You-Know-Who. It’s here at Hogwarts, but we don’t know where. It might have belonged to Ravenclaw. Has anyone heard of an object like that? Has anyone ever come across something with her eagle on it, for instance? When was it lost? And none of you have ever seen anything that looks like it? He’s on the move, Listen, I know it’s not much of a lead, but I’m going to go and look at this statue, at least find out what the diadem looks like. Wait for me here and keep, you know — the other one — safe. How do we get out? No problem, See you in a bit. Get under here, We’re up on the fifth floor, Come on, this way. What? Isn’t there just a password? What if you get it wrong? Thing was, Luna, where are you? I need to get under the Cloak! Yeah . . . great . . . You shouldn’t have done that. Crucio! I see what Bellatrix meant, you need to really mean it. He spat at you, Yeah, I do, Professor McGonagall, Voldemort’s on the way. I don’t think it makes any difference what we call him, He already knows where I am. I can’t, There’s something I need to do. Professor, do you know where the diadem of Ravenclaw is? Have you got any idea where the diadem of Ravenclaw is? I had to, Professor, there’s something hidden here that I’m supposed to find, and it could be the diadem — if I could just speak to Professor Flitwick — Time’s running out, Voldemort’s getting nearer. Professor, I’m acting on Dumbledore’s orders, I must find what he wanted me to find! But we’ve got to get the students out while I’m searching the castle — it’s me Voldemort wants, but he won’t care about killing a few more or less, not now — Is that possible? Let me — There’s a way, I know, Professor, but if Voldemort and the Death Eaters are concentrating on the school boundaries they won’t be interested in anyone who’s Disapparating out of the Hog’s Head. You mean he’s dead? Professor! Professor, we’ve got to barricade the school, he’s coming now! Professor, Professor, I’m sorry to interrupt, but this is important. Have you got any idea where the diadem of Ravenclaw is? I only meant — do you know where it is? Have you ever seen it? Wh — ? Voldemort’s on his way, they’re barricading the school — Snape’s run for it — What are you doing here? How did you know? They’re evacuating the younger kids and everyone’s meeting in the Great Hall to get organized, We’re fighting. Where’s Ron? Where’s Hermione? I didn’t see them pass me, A bathroom? You’re sure they said bath — ? What? Oh, oh yeah! Right — yeah — Nick! NICK! I need to talk to you! Nick, you’ve got to help me. Who’s the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower? It’s got to be her — d’you know where she is? Hey — wait — come back! You’re the Gray Lady? The ghost of Ravenclaw Tower? Please: I need some help. I need to know anything you can tell me about the lost diadem. WAIT! This is urgent, If that diadem’s at Hogwarts, I’ve got to find it, fast. This isn’t about trying to get better marks! It’s about Voldemort — defeating Voldemort — or aren’t you interested in that? Well, help me, then! Your mother’s? You’re her daughter? But then, you must know what happened to it! Haven’t I just told you, I’m not interested in wearing it! There’s no time to explain — but if you care about Hogwarts, if you want to see Voldemort finished, you’ve got to tell me anything you know about the diadem! What? The Baron? You mean — ? And . . . and the diadem? A hollow tree? What tree? Where was this? Albania, You’ve already told someone this story, haven’t you? Another student? Well, you weren’t the first person Riddle wormed things out of, He could be charming when he wanted. . . . — the night he asked for a job! He hid the diadem in the castle, the night he asked Dumbledore to let him teach! He must’ve hidden the diadem on his way up to, or down from, Dumbledore’s office! But it was still worth trying to get the job — then he might’ve got the chance to nick Gryffindor’s sword as well — thank you, thanks! Hagrid! What the — ? Hagrid, where have you come from? That, is a really good question. Come on. I dunno exactly, but Ron and Hermione must be around here somewhere. . . . I know, we’re evacuating, It wouldn’t stop Voldemort, and your brother would never have done it. Where the hell have you been? What? What the — ? But how did you get in there? You need to speak Parseltongue! So . . . So . . . Genius! Come on. He hid it exactly where I hid my old Potions book, where everyone’s been hiding stuff for centuries. He thought he was the only one to find it. Come on. ’S far as we know, Are there still people in the passage to the Hog’s Head? “He’s fighting,” said Harry. I thought you were supposed to be with Teddy at your mother’s? He was planning to lead a group of fighters into the grounds — Ginny, I’m sorry, but we need you to leave too. Just for a bit. Then you can come back in. And then you can come back in! You mean we ought to get them fighting? Is this the moment? OI! There’s a war going on here! Never mind that, what about the Horcrux? D’you think you could just — just hold it in until we’ve got the diadem? They’ll be all right, Ginny, we’ll be back in a moment, just keep out of the way, keep safe — come on! He thought he was the only one, Too bad for him I’ve had to hide stuff in my time . . . this way, I think it’s down here. . . . Let’s split up, Look for a stone bust of an old man wearing a wig and a tiara! It’s standing on a cupboard and it’s definitely somewhere near here. . . . Somewhere near here, Somewhere . . . somewhere . . . Not anymore, Winners, keepers, Malfoy. Who’s lent you theirs? So how come you three aren’t with Voldemort? Good plan, So how did you get in here? Ron! Finite! Expelliarmus! Aguamenti! Here! Where was this? She was here. She was supposed to be going back into the Room of Requirement. What? Oh, Oh yeah — What? Must’ve learned from the Carrows, He’s in the Shrieking Shack. The snake’s with him, it’s got some sort of magical protection around it. He’s just sent Lucius Malfoy to find Snape. He doesn’t think he needs to fight, He thinks I’m going to go to him. He knows I’m after Horcruxes — he’s keeping Nagini close beside him — obviously I’m going to have to go to him to get near the thing — You two stay here, I’ll go under the Cloak and I’ll be back as soon as I — LET’S GO! NO! HAGRID, COME BACK! HAGRID! HAGRID! HAGRID! HAGRID! HAGGER? RUN! Something happy? RUN! The Whomping Willow, Wait. With difficulty he dragged it over himself, murmured, Nox, extinguishing his wandlight, and continued on his hands and knees, as silently as possible, all his senses straining, expecting every second to be discovered, to hear a cold clear voice, see a flash of green light. Neville. It’s all part of the plan, There’s something I’ve got to do. Listen — Neville — No, ’Course not . . . this is something else. But I might be out of sight for a while. You know Voldemort’s snake, Neville? He’s got a huge snake. . . . Calls it Nagini . . . dying. Ron and Hermione know that, but just in case they — Just in case they’re — busy — and you get the chance — dying. Neville. Yeah, I — Would it hurt to die? I didn’t want you to die, Any of you. I’m sorry — I’m sorry — — right after you’d had your son . . . Remus, I’m sorry — You’ll stay with me? They won’t be able to see you? Stay close to me, You weren’t. But you’re dead, Then . . . I’m dead too? Not? But . . . But I should have died — I didn’t defend myself! I meant to let him kill me! Explain, I let him kill me, Didn’t I? So the part of his soul that was in me . . . . . . has it gone? But . . . What is that, Professor? But if Voldemort used the Killing Curse, and nobody died for me this time — how can I be alive? He took my blood, Didn’t I? But I thought . . . I thought it was the other way round! I thought we both had to die? Or is it the same thing? Are you sure we can’t do anything? Then explain . . . more, And you knew this? You knew — all along? There’s more, There’s more to it. Why did my wand break the wand he borrowed? Have a guess, then, But if my wand was so powerful, how come Hermione was able to break it? He killed me with your wand. I feel great at the moment, though, Where are we, exactly? It looks, like King’s Cross station. Except a lot cleaner and empty, and there are no trains as far as I can see. Well, where do you think we are? The Deathly Hallows, Well? What are you talking about? But they’re real! What do I know? Of course you were, Of course — how can you ask that? You never killed if you could avoid it! Not the way he did, Hallows, not Horcruxes. Hallows, not Horcruxes. Grindelwald was looking for them too? So it’s true? All of it? The Peverell brothers — Me? The Cloak wouldn’t have helped them survive, though, Harry said quickly. Voldemort knew where my mum and dad were. The Cloak couldn’t have made them curse-proof. So you’d given up looking for the Hallows when you saw the Cloak? But I don’t despise you — But you’d have been better, much better, than Fudge or Scrimgeour! You were the best — Grindelwald tried to stop Voldemort going after the wand. He lied, you know, pretended he had never had it. . . . or maybe from breaking into your tomb? You tried to use the Resurrection Stone. Why? It was natural! You wanted to see them again. What’s wrong with that? Why did you have to make it so difficult? And Voldemort never knew about the Hallows? But you expected him to go after the wand? Would I? Oh yes, That bit didn’t work out. Would I? I’ve got a choice? And where would it take me? Yes, Protego! I don’t want anyone else to try to help, It’s got to be like this. It’s got to be me. Nobody, There are no more Horcruxes. It’s just you and me. Neither can live while the other survives, and one of us is about to leave for good. . . . Accident, was it, when my mother died to save me? Accident, when I decided to fight in that graveyard? Accident, that I didn’t defend myself tonight, and still survived, and returned to fight again? You won’t be killing anyone else tonight, You won’t be able to kill any of them ever again. Don’t you get it? I was ready to die to stop you from hurting these people — — I meant to, and that’s what did it. I’ve done what my mother did. They’re protected from you. Haven’t you noticed how none of the spells you put on them are binding? You can’t torture them. You can’t touch them. You don’t learn from your mistakes, Riddle, do you? Yes, I know lots of important things that you don’t. Want to hear some, before you make another big mistake? Just one thing, I believe both, Oh, he dreamed of it, but he knew more than you, knew enough not to do what you’ve done. No, he was cleverer than you, a better wizard, a better man. You thought you did, but you were wrong. Yes, but you didn’t have him killed. He chose his own manner of dying, chose it months before he died, arranged the whole thing with the man you thought was your servant. Snape was Dumbledore’s, Dumbledore’s from the moment you started hunting down my mother. And you never realized it, because of the thing you can’t understand. You never saw Snape cast a Patronus, did you, Riddle? Snape’s Patronus was a doe, the same as my mother’s, because he loved her for nearly all of his life, from the time when they were children. You should have realized, he asked you to spare her life, didn’t he? Of course he told you that, but he was Dumbledore’s spy from the moment you threatened her, and he’s been working against you ever since! Dumbledore was already dying when Snape finished him! Yeah, it did, You’re right. But before you try to kill me, I’d advise you to think about what you’ve done. . . . Think, and try for some remorse, Riddle. . . . It’s your one last chance, it’s all you’ve got left. . . . I’ve seen what you’ll be otherwise. . . . Be a man . . . try . . . Try for some remorse. . . . Yes, because Dumbledore’s last plan hasn’t backfired on me at all. It’s backfired on you, Riddle. That wand still isn’t working properly for you because you murdered the wrong person. Aren’t you listening? Snape never beat Dumbledore! Dumbledore’s death was planned between them! Dumbledore intended to die undefeated, the wand’s last true master! If all had gone as planned, the wand’s power would have died with him, because it had never been won from him! You still don’t get it, Riddle, do you? Possessing the wand isn’t enough! Holding it, using it, doesn’t make it really yours. Didn’t you listen to Ollivander? The wand chooses the wizard. . . . The Elder Wand recognized a new master before Dumbledore died, someone who never even laid a hand on it. The new master removed the wand from Dumbledore against his will, never realizing exactly what he had done, or that the world’s most dangerous wand had given him its allegiance. . . . But you’re too late, You’ve missed your chance. So it all comes down to this, doesn’t it? Does the wand in your hand know its last master was Disarmed? Because if it does . . . I am the true master of the Elder Wand. Expelliarmus! Can we go up? The thing that was hidden in the Snitch, I dropped it in the forest. I don’t know exactly where, but I’m not going to go looking for it again. Do you agree? Tell me whether he is dead. I’m going to keep Ignotus’s present, though, And then there’s this. I don’t want it, I know it’s powerful, But I was happier with mine. So . . . Reparo. I’m putting the Elder Wand,back where it came from. It can stay there. If I die a natural death like Ignotus, its power will be broken, won’t it? The previous master will never have been defeated. That’ll be the end of it. It won’t be long, and you’ll be going too, And you don’t want to believe everything he tells you about Hogwarts, He likes a laugh, your brother.",

That car’s new, he’s not sitting in it alone. . . . I’m warning you, I’m warning you now, boy — any funny business, anything at all — and you’ll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas. . . . roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums, MOTORCYCLES DON’T FLY! Get the mail, Dudley Poke him with your Smelting stick, Who’d be writing to you? P-P-Petunia! Get out, both of you, Get out, SILENCE! Er — yes, Harry — about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been thinking . . . you’re really getting a bit big for it . . . we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley’s second bedroom. Oh, Don’t touch anything he gives you, Dudley. STOP! I FORBID YOU! He’s not going, We swore when we took him in we’d put a stop to that rubbish, swore we’d stamp it out of him! Load of old tosh, Now, you listen here, boy, I accept there’s something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn’t have cured He’s going to Stonewall High and he’ll be grateful for it. I’ve read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish — spell books and wands and — I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS! Grunt. Funny way to get to a wizards’ school, the train. Magic carpets all got punctures, have they?” “Where is this school, anyway?” “Barking,” “howling mad, the lot of them. You’ll see. You just wait. All right, we’ll take you to King’s Cross. We’re going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn’t bother.” Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine — platform ten. Your platform should be somewhere in the middle, but they don’t seem to have built it yet, do they? Have a good term, Nonsense, Petunia, I never went hungry when I was at Smeltings, Dudley gets enough, don’t you, son? HOW DARE YOU THREATEN DUDLEY! I WARNED YOU! I WILL NOT TOLERATE MENTION OF YOUR ABNORMALITY UNDER THIS ROOF! “Just our nephew — very disturbed — meeting strangers upsets him, so we kept him upstairs. . . .” “THAT RUDDY OWL!” No need to tell us he’s no good, Look at the state of him, the filthy layabout! Look at his hair! When will they learn, that hanging’s the only way to deal with these people? I’d better be off in a minute, Petunia. Marge’s train gets in at ten. Firstly, you’ll keep a civil tongue in your head when you’re talking to Marge. Secondly, as Marge doesn’t know anything about your abnormality, I don’t want any — any funny stuff while she’s here. You behave yourself, got me? And thirdly, we’ve told Marge you attend St. Brutus’s Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys. And you’ll be sticking to that story, boy, or there’ll be trouble, Well, Petunia, I’ll be off to the station, then. Want to come along for the ride, Dudders? “See you in a bit, then,” I’m not taking you, So? And why should I do that? St. Brutus’s Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys! You’ll get the stuffing knocked out of you, won’t you? Well, I shall monitor your behavior carefully during Marge’s visit. If, at the end of it, you’ve toed the line and kept to the story, I’ll sign your ruddy form. Who’s looking after the other dogs, Marge? St. Brutus’s, It’s a first-rate institution for hopeless cases. Er — Heard the news this morning, Marge? What about that escaped prisoner, eh? Can I tempt you, Marge? Now, this one here — Unemployed. MORE BRANDY! You, boy, Go to bed, go on — NOOOOOOO! COME BACK IN HERE! COME BACK AND PUT HER RIGHT! So, So. This just arrived, Look at this, The postman noticed, Very interested to know where this letter came from, he was. That’s why he rang the doorbell. Seemed to think it was funny. Who is this woman? Dumpy sort of woman? Load of children with red hair? Quidditch, Quidditch — what is this rubbish? All right, all right! What does she mean, ‘the normal way’? How many times do I have to tell you not to mention that unnaturalness under my roof? You stand there, in the clothes Petunia and I have put on your ungrateful back — I will not be spoken to like that! You’re — you’re writing to him, are you? You, You can go to this ruddy . . . this stupid . . . this World Cup thing. You write and tell these — these Weasleys they’re to pick you up, mind. I haven’t got time to go dropping you off all over the country. And you can spend the rest of the summer there. And you can tell your — your godfather . . . tell him . . . tell him you’re going. Okay then, I hope you told them to dress properly, these people, I’ve seen the sort of stuff your lot wear. They’d better have the decency to put on normal clothes, that’s all. They’ll be driving, of course? They’re late! No consideration at all. We might’ve had an engagement. Well, they most certainly won’t be, They’ll take the boy and go, there’ll be no hanging around. That’s if they’re coming at all. Probably mistaken the day. I daresay their kind don’t set much store by punctuality. Either that or they drive some tin-pot car that’s broken d — AAAAAAAARRRRRGH! What is this? What’s going on? Wait a moment! See you, See you, as if we’re interested in their sordid affairs, Making a racket like a starting pistol right outside our — No more do I, We’re not stupid, you know, Give us names. We’ll get them, don’t worry. You’re going to stay here and explain how my son — “Ministry of Magic?” What did you do to Dudley? Go on, son, Go on, son, Right, I won’t give up hope, then, Hang on, But he’s gone, That giant bloke said so. He’s gone. Hang on, I see, Well, that settles it, We’re going out, You are not to leave your bedroom while we are away. You are not to touch the television, the stereo, or any of our possessions. You are not to steal food from the fridge. I am going to lock your door. Who the blazes is calling at this time of night? You will, will you? His godfather’s dead? His godfather? He’s been left a house? Will you get these ruddy things off us? What the hell is that? Preposterous, Us — mistreat Dudders? What d’you — ? Oi! You! BOY! You took your time! Get down here, I want a word! Sit down! Please! I’ve changed my mind, It’s all a lot of claptrap, I’ve decided I don’t believe a word of it. We’re staying put, we’re not going anywhere. According to you, we — Petunia, Dudley, and I — are in danger. From — from — Well, I don’t believe it, I was awake half the night thinking it all over, and I believe it’s a plot to get the house. This house! Our house! House prices are skyrocketing around here! You want us out of the way and then you’re going to do a bit of hocus-pocus and before we know it the deeds will be in your name and — You claim, I thought there was a Ministry of Magic? Well, then, why can’t they protect us? It seems to me that, as innocent victims, guilty of nothing more than harboring a marked man, we ought to qualify for government protection! All right, All right, let’s say, for the sake of argument, we accept this protection. I still don’t see why we can’t have that Kingsley bloke. Exactly — he’s the best! If we’d even seen CVs . . . All right, all right, But what about my work? What about Dudley’s school? I don’t suppose those things matter to a bunch of layabout wizards — Know how to — ? Of course I ruddy well know how to drive! Can’t even drive, Well, this is good-bye, then, boy. Come along, then, You took your time! Don’t these people realize what you’ve been through? Well, he — he doesn’t want to, You don’t want to, do you? There you are, Now come on, we’re off. What now? Dudley, He’s off with some of your lot, isn’t he? Right, Dudley, let’s get in the car, you heard the man, we’re in a hurry. Are we going or not? I thought we were on a tight schedule!",

It’s not been an easy journey. . . . Budge up, yeh great lump, An’ here’s Harry! Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune, True, I haven’t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts. Yer great puddin’ of a son don’ need fattenin’ anymore, Dursley, don’ worry. Sorry? It’s them as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren’t gettin’ yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn’t even know abou’ Hogwarts, fer cryin’ out loud! Did yeh never wonder where yer parents learned it all? ALL WHAT? About our world, I mean. Your world. My world. Yer parents’ world. DURSLEY! You never told him? Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore left fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An’ you’ve kept it from him all these years? Gallopin’ Gorgons, that reminds me, Where was I? I’d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him, A Muggle, it’s what we call nonmagic folk like them. An’ it’s your bad luck you grew up in a family o’ the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on. How could a car crash kill Lily an’ James Potter? It’s an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin’ his own story when every kid in our world knows his name! I never expected this, I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin’ hold of yeh, how much yeh didn’t know. Ah, Harry, I don’ know if I’m the right person ter tell yeh — but someone’s gotta — yeh can’t go off ter Hogwarts not knowin’. Well, it’s best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh — mind, I can’t tell yeh everythin’, it’s a great myst’ry, parts of it. . . . It begins, I suppose, with — with a person called — but it’s incredible yeh don’t know his name, everyone in our world knows — Gulpin’ gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard who went . . . bad. As bad as you could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was . . . Nah — can’t spell it. All right — Voldemort. Don’ make me say it again. Anyway, this — this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started lookin’ fer followers. Dark days, Harry. Didn’t know who ter trust, didn’t dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches . . . terrible things happened. He was takin’ over. ’ ’Course, some stood up to him — an’ he killed ’em. Reckon Dumbledore’s the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of. Didn’t dare try takin’ the school, not jus’ then, anyway. Now, yer mum an’ dad were as good a witch an’ wizard as I ever knew. Head boy an’ girl at Hogwarts in their day! Suppose the myst’ry is why You-Know-Who never tried to get ’em on his side before . . . probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin’ ter do with the Dark Side. Maybe he thought he could persuade ’em . . . maybe he just wanted ’em outta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a year old. He came ter yer house an’— an’— Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore’s orders. Brought yeh ter this lot . . . I’m warning you, Dursley — I’m warning you — one more word . . . That’s better, Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die. Some say he’s still out there, bidin’ his time, like, but I don’ believe it. People who was on his side came back ter ours. Some of ’em came outta kinda trances. Don’ reckon they could’ve done if he was comin’ back. Most of us reckon he’s still out there somewhere but lost his powers. Too weak to carry on. ’Cause somethin’ about you finished him, Harry. There was somethin’ goin’ on that night he hadn’t counted on — I dunno what it was, no one does — but somethin’ about you stumped him, all right. Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was scared or angry? If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won’t stop him, His name’s been down ever since he was born. He’s off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years there and he won’t know himself. He’ll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an’ he’ll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had, Albus Dumbled — NEVER —  INSULT — ALBUS — DUMBLEDORE — IN — FRONT — OF — ME! Shouldn’ta lost me temper, but it didn’t work anyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasn’t much left ter do. Be grateful if yeh didn’t mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts, I’m — er — not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin’. I was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an’ get yer letters to yeh an’ stuff — one o’ the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job — Oh, well — I was at Hogwarts meself but I — er — got expelled, ter tell yeh the truth. In me third year. They snapped me wand in half an’ everything. But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great man, Dumbledore. It’s gettin’ late and we’ve got lots ter do tomorrow, Gotta get up ter town, get all yer books an’ that. You can kip under that, Don’t do that. Pay him, He wants payin’ fer deliverin’ the paper. Look in the pockets. Give him five Knuts, The little bronze ones. Best be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an’ buy all yer stuff fer school. Mm? They didn’ keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us is Gringotts. Wizards’ bank. Have a sausage, they’re not bad cold — an’ I wouldn’ say no teh a bit o’ yer birthday cake, neither. Just the one. He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. Fetchin’ you — gettin’ things from Gringotts — knows he can trust me, see. Got everythin’? Got everythin’? Come on, then. Flew, Spells — enchantments, They say there’s dragons guardin’ the high-security vaults. And then yeh gotta find yer way — Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh’d die of hunger tryin’ ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat. Ministry o’ Magic messin’ things up as usual, ’Course, Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning, askin’ fer advice. Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there’s still witches an’ wizards up an’ down the country. What? Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone’d be wantin’ magic solutions to their problems. Nah, we’re best left alone. See that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh? Well, so they say, Crikey, I’d like a dragon. Wanted one ever since I was a kid — here we go. Still got yer letter, Good, There’s a list there of everything yeh need. If yeh know where to go, I don’t know how the Muggles manage without magic, This is it, the Leaky Cauldron. It’s a famous place. Can’t, Tom, I’m on Hogwarts business, Must get on — lots ter buy. Come on, Harry. Told yeh, didn’t I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind you, he’s usually tremblin’. Oh, yeah.  Poor bloke. Scared of the students, scared of his own subject — now, where’s me umbrella? Right, Gringotts, Yeah, that’s a goblin, Like I said, yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it Morning, We’ve come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter’s safe. Got it here somewhere, Got it, That seems to be in order. An’ I’ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore, It’s about the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen. Can’t tell yeh that, Very secret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledore’s trusted me. More’n my job’s worth ter tell yeh that. Stalagmite’s got an ‘m’ in it, An’ don’ ask me questions just now, I think I’m gonna be sick. All yours, Right, Vault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly? Might as well get yer uniform, Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts. What’s up?” No, Yer not from a Muggle family.  If he’d known who yeh were — he’s grown up knowin’ yer name if his parents are wizardin’ folk. You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway, what does he know about it, some o’ the best I ever saw were the only ones with magic in ’em in a long line o’ Muggles — look at yer mum! Look what she had fer a sister! It’s our sport. Wizard sport. It’s like — like soccer in the Muggle world — everyone follows Quidditch — played up in the air on broomsticks and there’s four balls — sorta hard ter explain the rules. School Houses. There’s four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o’ duffers, but — There’s not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn’t in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one. Years an’ years ago, I’m not sayin’ that’s not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances, An’ anyway, yeh couldn’ work any of them curses yet, yeh’ll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level. Oh, I know I don’t have to. Tell yeh what, I’ll get yer animal. Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh’d be laughed at —  an’ I don’ like cats, they make me sneeze. Don’ mention it, Don’ expect you’ve had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now — only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand. It was, sir, yes, Yes, I’ve still got the pieces, though,” Oh, Don’ you worry, Harry. You’ll learn fast enough. Just be yerself. I know it’s hard. Yeh’ve been singled out, an’ that’s always hard. But yeh’ll have a great time at Hogwarts — I did — still do, ’smatter of fact. Yer ticket fer Hogwarts, First o’ September — King’s Cross — it’s all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she’ll know where to find me. . . . See yeh soon, Harry. “Back, Fang — back.” “Make yerselves at home,” An’ as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I’d like ter introduce her to Fang sometime. D’yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can’t get rid of her — Filch puts her up to it.” Budge up there, move along. Bin watchin’ from me hut, But it isn’t the same as bein’ in the crowd. No sign of the Snitch yet, eh? Kept outta trouble, though, that’s somethin’, Dunno what Harry thinks he’s doing, If I didn’ know better, I’d say he’d lost control of his broom . . . but he can’t have. . . . Can’t have, Can’t nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic — no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand. Rubbish, How do you know about Fluffy? Yeah — he’s mine — bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las’ year — I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the — Now, don’t ask me anymore, Rubbish, Snape’s a Hogwarts teacher, he’d do nothin’ of the sort. I’m tellin’ yeh, yer wrong! I don’ know why Harry’s broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn’ try an’ kill a student! Now, listen to me, all three of yeh — yer meddlin’ in things that don’ concern yeh. It’s dangerous. Nah, I’m all right, thanks, Ron. He was provoked, Professor Snape, Malfoy was insultin’ his family. Come on, cheer up, it’s nearly Christmas, Tell yeh what, come with me an’ see the Great Hall, looks a treat. Listen here — I’ve told yeh — drop it. It’s nothin’ to you what that dog’s guardin’. I’m sayin’ nothin’, Who is it? So — yeh wanted to ask me somethin’? O’ course I can’t, Number one, I don’ know meself. Number two, yeh know too much already, so I wouldn’ tell yeh if I could. That Stone’s here fer a good reason. It was almost stolen outta Gringotts — I s’ppose yeh’ve worked that out an’ all? Beats me how yeh even know abou’ Fluffy. Well, I don’ s’pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that . . . let’s see . . . he borrowed Fluffy from me . . . then some o’ the teachers did enchantments . . . Professor Sprout — Professor Flitwick — Professor McGonagall — Professor Quirrell — an’ Dumbledore himself did somethin’, o’ course. Hang on, I’ve forgotten someone. Oh yeah, Professor Snape. Yeah — yer not still on abou’ that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped protect the Stone, he’s not about ter steal it. “Not a soul knows except me an’ Dumbledore,” “Can’t, Harry, sorry,” “Ah,That’s — er . . .” Las’ night. I was down in the village havin’ a few drinks an’ got into a game o’ cards with a stranger. Think he was quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest. It’s nearly out. “I — I know I can’t keep him forever, but I can’t jus’ dump him, I can’t.” He’s got lots o’ rats an’ some brandy fer the journey, An’ I’ve packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely. That’s why yer late, is it?” “Bin lecturin’ them, eh? ’Snot your place ter do that. Yeh’ve done yer bit, I’ll take over from here.” “Look there,”  see that stuff shinin’ on the ground? Silvery stuff? That’s unicorn blood. There’s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat.  We’re gonna try an’ find the poor thing. We might have ter put it out of its misery.” “There’s nothin’ that lives in the forest that’ll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang,”   There’s blood all over the place, it must’ve bin staggerin’ around since last night at least.” “Can’t be too careful, Ronan,” There’s summat bad loose in this forest. “Oh, a fair few. . . . Keep themselves to themselves mostly, but they’re good enough about turnin’ up if ever I want a word. They’re deep, mind, centaurs . . . they know things . . . jus’ don’ let on much.” “It’s not that unusual, yeh get a lot o’ funny folk in the Hog’s Head — that’s one o’ the pubs down in the village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn’ he? I never saw his face, he kept his hood up.” he said. “Well — yeah — how many three-headed dogs d’yeh meet, even around Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy’s a piece o’ cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus’ play him a bit o’ music an’ he’ll go straight off ter sleep —” That reminds me. I’ve got yeh a present. Nah. Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it. ’Course, he shoulda sacked me instead — anyway, got yeh this . . . “Sent owls off ter all yer parents’ old school friends, askin’ fer photos . . . knew yeh didn’ have any . . . d’yeh like it?” Givin’ me advice on gettin’ kelpies out of a well, Like I don’ know. An’ bangin’ on about some banshee he banished. If one word of it was true, I’ll eat my kettle. “He didn’! An’ they haven’t invented a spell our Hermione can’ do, Well, I don’ blame yeh fer tryin’ ter curse him, Ron, Bu’ maybe it was a good thing yer wand backfired. ’Spect Lucius Malfoy would’ve come marchin’ up ter school if yeh’d cursed his son. Least yer not in trouble. I’m on’y jokin’  I knew yeh hadn’t really. I told Lockhart yeh didn’ need teh. Yer more famous than him without tryin’. Don’ think he did, An’ then I told him I’d never read one o’ his books an’ he decided ter go. Treacle toffee, Ron? Yeh sure yeh’re all righ’? Yeh look all hot an’ bothered — “Oh, I heard, all righ’,” All righ’? Yer in my firs’ ever lesson! Right after lunch! Bin up since five gettin’ everythin’ ready. . . . Hope it’s okay. . . . Me, a teacher . C’mon, now, get a move on! Got a real treat for yeh today! Great lesson comin’ up! Everyone here? Right, follow me! Everyone gather ’round the fence here! Eh? I — I thought they were funny, Righ’ then, so — so yeh’ve got yer books an’ — an’ — now yeh need the Magical Creatures. Hang on . . . Gee up, there! Hippogriffs! Beau’iful, aren’ they? Yeh always wait fer the hippogriff ter make the firs’ move, It’s polite, see? Yeh walk toward him, and yeh bow, an’ yeh wait. If he bows back, yeh’re allowed ter touch him. If he doesn’ bow, then get away from him sharpish, ’cause those talons hurt. Right — who wants ter go first? No one? Good man, Harry! Right then — let’s see how yeh get on with Buckbeak. Harry, Yeh’ve got eye contact, now try not ter blink. . . .  if yeh blink too much. Hippogriffs don’ trust yeh Tha’s it, Tha’s it, Harry . . . now, bow . . . Harry, Well done, Harry! Right — yeh can touch him! Pat his beak, go on! Harry, I reckon he might’ let yeh ride him! Yeh climb up there, jus’ behind the wing joint, an’ mind yeh don’ pull any of his feathers out, he won’ like that. . . . Go on, then! Right, Okay, who else wants a go? Someone help me — gotta get him outta here — C’min. ’Spect it’s a record, Don’ reckon they’ve ever had a teacher who lasted on’y a day before. Not yet, But ’s only a matter o’ time, i’n’t it, after Malfoy . . . School gov’nors have bin told, o’ course, They reckon I started too big. Shoulda left hippogriffs fer later . . . done flobberworms or summat. . . . Jus’ thought it’d make a good firs’ lesson. . . . ’S all my fault. . . . Ar, maybe she’s right, Tha’s better, he said, “Listen, it was good of yeh ter come an’ see me, I really —” Eh? Harry, Me, I’m takin’ yer all back up ter school, an’ don’ let me catch yeh walkin’ down ter see me after dark again. I’m not worth that! Yeh’ve heard? Yeh don’ know them gargoyles at the Committee fer the Disposal o’ Dangerous Creatures! They’ve got it in fer interestin’ creatures! I couldn’ leave him tied up out there in the snow! All on his own! At Christmas. Won’t make no diff’rence! Them Disposal devils, they’re all in Lucius Malfoy’s pocket! Scared o’ him! An’ if I lose the case, Buckbeak — He’s done more’n enough fer me already, Got enough on his plate what with keepin’ them dementors outta the castle, an’ Sirius Black lurkin’ around — Yer right. I can’ afford to go ter pieces. Gotta pull meself together. . . . I’ve not bin meself lately, Worried abou’ Buckbeak, an’ no one likin’ me classes — Dead, Too much lettuce. An’ them dementors make me feel ruddy terrible an’ all, Gotta walk past ’em ev’ry time I want a drink in the Three Broomsticks. ’S like bein’ back in Azkaban — Yeh’ve no idea,  Thought I was goin’ mad. Kep’ goin’ over horrible stuff in me mind . . . the day I got expelled from Hogwarts . . . day me dad died . . . day I had ter let Norbert go. Yeh can’ really remember who yeh are after a while. An’ yeh can’ see the point o’ livin’ at all. I used ter hope I’d jus’ die in me sleep. . . . When they let me out, it was like bein’ born again, ev’rythin’ came floodin’ back, it was the bes’ feelin’ in the world. Mind, the dementors weren’t keen on lettin’ me go. Think that matters to them? They don’ care. Long as they’ve got a couple o’ hundred humans stuck there with ’em, so they can leech all the happiness out of ’em, they don’ give a damn who’s guilty an’ who’s not. Thought o’ jus’ letting Buckbeak go . . . tryin’ ter make him fly away . . . but how d’yeh explain ter a hippogriff it’s gotta go inter hidin’? An’ — an’ I’m scared o’ breakin’ the law. . . . I don’ ever want ter go back ter Azkaban. Ruddy brilliant! Buckbeak’s case against the Committee fer the Disposal o’ Dangerous Creatures, This Friday. Him an’ me’ll be goin’ down ter London together. I’ve booked two beds on the Knight Bus. . . . I got somethin’ ter discuss with you two, Hermione, Firs’ yeh weren’ talking to her because o’ the Firebolt, now yer not talkin’ to her because her cat — Because her cat acted like all cats do, She’s cried a fair few times, yeh know. Goin’ through a rough time at the moment. Bitten off more’n she can chew, if yeh ask me, all the work she’s tryin’ ter do. Still found time ter help me with Buckbeak’s case, mind. . . . She’s found some really good stuff fer me . . . reckon he’ll stand a good chance now. I’m not blamin’ yeh! Gawd knows yeh’ve had enough ter be gettin’ on with. I’ve seen yeh practicin’ Quidditch ev’ry hour o’ the day an’ night — but I gotta tell yeh, I thought you two’d value yer friend more’n broomsticks or rats. Tha’s all. Really upset, she was, when Black nearly stabbed yeh, Ron. She’s got her heart in the right place, Hermione has, an’ you two not talkin’ to her — Ah, well, people can be a bit stupid abou’ their pets, Yeh beat ’em, Harry, yeh beat ’em! Wait till I tell Buckbeak! Yeh shouldn’ve come! Wan’ some tea? “There’s another one in the cupboard,” He’s tried, He’s got no power ter overrule the Committee. He told ’em Buckbeak’s all right, but they’re scared. . . . Yeh know what Lucius Malfoy’s like . . . threatened ’em, I expect . . . an’ the executioner, Macnair, he’s an old pal o’ Malfoy’s . . . but it’ll be quick an’ clean . . . an’ I’ll be beside him. . . . Dumbledore’s gonna come down while it — while it happens. Wrote me this mornin’. Said he wants ter — ter be with me. Great man, Dumbledore. . . . Yeh’re ter go back up ter the castle. I told yeh, I don’ wan’ yeh watchin’. An’ yeh shouldn’ be down here anyway. . . . If Fudge an’ Dumbledore catch yeh out without permission, Harry, yeh’ll be in big trouble. “They’re comin’. . . .” Yeh gotta go, They mustn’ find yeh here. . . . Go now. . . . I’ll let yeh out the back way, “It’s okay . . .” Yeh shouldn’ve come! Know I shouldn’ feel happy, after wha’ happened las’ night, Beaky! He escaped! He’s free! Bin celebratin’ all night! Yeah . . . can’t’ve tied him up properly, I was worried this mornin’, mind . . . thought he mighta met Professor Lupin on the grounds, but Lupin says he never ate anythin’ las’ night. . . . Blimey, haven’ yeh heard? Er — Snape told all the Slytherins this mornin’. . . . Thought everyone’d know by now . . . Professor Lupin’s a werewolf, see. An’ he was loose on the grounds las’ night. . . . He’s packin’ now, o’ course. Leavin’, isn’ he? Resigned firs’ thing this mornin’. Says he can’t risk it happenin’ again. But if he’s resigned — All righ’, Harry? See yeh at the feast if we don’ drown! You wait, You jus’ wait. Yer going ter see some stuff yeh’ve never seen before. Firs’ task . . . ah, but I’m not supposed ter say. I don’ want ter spoil it fer yeh, Never thought I’d live ter see the Triwizard Tournament played again! It’d be doin’ ’em an unkindness, Hermione, It’s in their nature ter look after humans, that’s what they like, see? Yeh’d be makin’ ’em unhappy ter take away their work, an’ insultin’ ’em if yeh tried ter pay ’em. Yeah, I’m not sayin’ there isn’t the odd elf who’d take freedom, but yeh’ll never persuade most of ’em ter do it — no, nothin’ doin’, Hermione. I’ll come with yeh, Jus’ give us a sec. Eh? Don’ yeh like it? Er — eau de cologne, Maybe it’s a bit much, I’ll go take it off, hang on . . . All right, Hermione? Harry, meet me tonight at midnight at me cabin. Wear that Cloak. Nice ter see yeh, Hermione, You there, Harry? Got summat ter show yeh, Come with me, keep quiet, an’ keep yerself covered with that Cloak, We won’ take Fang, he won’ like it. . . . Shhh! Bong-sewer, Yeh’ll enjoy this, worth seein’, trust me. On’y — don’ go tellin’ anyone I showed yeh, right? Yeh’re not s’posed ter know. Harry! Yeh did it! An’ agains’ the Horntail an’ all, an’ yeh know Charlie said that was the wors’ — Who’re you? Thought Dumbledore said you weren’ allowed inside the school anymore, Blast-Ended Skrewts, This is on’y me second year, Blast-Ended Skrewts, Er — yeah, why not? She didn’ seem very int’rested in magical creatures, ter tell yeh the truth, She jus’ wanted me ter talk about you, Harry, Well, I told her we’d been friends since I went ter fetch yeh from the Dursleys. ‘Never had to tell him off in four years? ’ she said. ‘Never played you up in lessons, has he? ’ I told her no, an’ she didn’ seem happy at all. Yeh’d think she wanted me to say yeh were horrible, Harry. But he’s not! Said that, did he? Well, yeh might’ve bent a few rules, Harry, bu’ yeh’re all righ’ really, aren’ you? Though’ I might look in on it, yeah, Should be a good do, I reckon. You’ll be openin’ the dancin’, won’ yeh, Harry? Who’re you takin’? Momen’ I saw yeh, I knew, I jus’ knew . . . knew you were like me. . . . Was it yer mother or yer father? It was my mother, She was one o’ the las’ ones in Britain. ’Course, I can’ remember her too well . . . she left, see. When I was abou’ three. She wasn’ really the maternal sort. Well . . . it’s not in their natures, is it? Dunno what happened to her . . . might be dead fer all I know. . . . Me dad was broken-hearted when she wen’. Tiny little bloke, my dad was. By the time I was six I could lift him up an’ put him on top o’ the dresser if he annoyed me. Used ter make him laugh. . . . Dad raised me . . . but he died, o’ course, jus’ after I started school. Sorta had ter make me own way after that.  Dumbledore was a real help, mind. Very kind ter me, he was. So . . . anyway . . . enough abou’ me. What about you? Which side you got it on? Eh? No, don’ go! I’ve — I’ve never met another one before! Another half-giant, o’ course! “’Lo, Not all of ’em, Not all of ’em wan’ me ter stay. Yeh — yeh’re not half-giant! Great man, Dumbledore . . . great man . . . Help yerself, Ar, he’s righ’, o’ course — yeh’re all righ’ . . . I bin stupid . . . my ol’ dad woulda bin ashamed o’ the way I’ve bin behavin’. . . . Never shown you a picture of my old dad, have I? Here . . . Tha’ was taken jus’ after I got inter Hogwarts, Dad was dead chuffed . . . thought I migh’ not be a wizard, see, ’cos me mum . . . well, anyway. ’Course, I never was great shakes at magic, really . . . but at least he never saw me expelled. Died, see, in me second year. . . . Dumbledore was the one who stuck up for me after Dad went. Got me the gamekeeper job . . . trusts people, he does. Gives ’em second chances . . . tha’s what sets him apar’ from other Heads, see. He’ll accept anyone at Hogwarts, s’long as they’ve got the talent. Knows people can turn out okay even if their families weren’ . . . well . . . all tha’ respectable. But some don’ understand that.  There’s some who’d always hold it against yeh . . . there’s some who’d even pretend they just had big bones rather than stand up an’ say — I am what I am, an’ I’m not ashamed. ‘Never be ashamed,’ my ol’ dad used ter say, ‘there’s some who’ll hold it against you, but they’re not worth botherin’ with. ’ An’ he was right. I’ve bin an idiot. I’m not botherin’ with her no more, I promise yeh that. Big bones . . . I’ll give her big bones. Harry! when I firs’ met you, you reminded me o’ me a bit. Mum an’ Dad gone, an’ you was feelin’ like yeh wouldn’ fit in at Hogwarts, remember? Not sure yeh were really up to it . . . an’ now look at yeh, Harry! School champion! Yeh know what I’d love, Harry? I’d love yeh ter win, I really would. It’d show ’em all . . . yeh don’ have ter be pureblood ter do it. Yeh don’ have ter be ashamed of what yeh are. It’d show ’em Dumbledore’s the one who’s got it righ’, lettin’ anyone in as long as they can do magic. How you doin’ with that egg, Harry? Tha’s my boy . . . you show ’em, Harry, you show ’em. Beat ’em all. These’re nifflers, Yeh find ’em down mines mostly. They like sparkly stuff. . . . There yeh go, look. Useful little treasure detectors, Thought we’d have some fun with ’em today. See over there? I’ve buried some gold coins. I’ve got a prize fer whoever picks the niffler that digs up most. Jus’ take off all yer valuables, an’ choose a niffler, an’ get ready ter set ’em loose. Hang on, there’s a spare niffler here . . . who’s missin’? Where’s Hermione? Yer mum wouldn’ be happy, Ron, They wreck houses, nifflers. I reckon they’ve nearly got the lot, now, I on’y buried a hundred coins. Oh there y’are, Hermione! Well, let’s check how yeh’ve done! Count yer coins! An’ there’s no point tryin’ ter steal any, Goyle, It’s leprechaun gold. Vanishes after a few hours. What yeh done ter your hands, Hermione? Aaah, don’ worry, ‘Yeh’re a monster an’ yeh should be put down. ’ ‘Yer mother killed innocent people an’ if you had any decency you’d jump in a lake. ’ Yeah, They’re jus’ nutters, Hermione. Don’ open ’em if yeh get any more. Chuck ’em straigh’ in the fire. Professor! Harry — what the — ? Crouch? Oh yeah . . . right y’are, Professor . . . Apologize! Maybe I’d better stay here, Headmaster. . . . I’ll leave Fang with yeh, Headmaster, Stay, Fang. C’mon, Harry. You did? How dare he accuse Dumbledore. Like Dumbledore’d do anythin’ like that. Like Dumbledore wanted you in the tournament in the firs’ place. Worried! I dunno when I seen Dumbledore more worried than he’s bin lately. An’ you! What were yeh doin’, wanderin’ off with ruddy Krum? He’s from Durmstrang, Harry! Coulda jinxed yeh right there, couldn’ he? Hasn’ Moody taught yeh nothin’? ’Magine lettin’ him lure yeh off on yer own — I’ll be havin’ a few words with her, an’ all, The less you lot ’ave ter do with these foreigners, the happier yeh’ll be. Yeh can’ trust any of ’em. Don’ you talk ter me abou’ her! I’ve got her number now! Tryin’ ter get back in me good books, tryin’ ter get me ter tell her what’s comin’ in the third task. Ha! You can’ trust any of ’em! Good luck, Harry, Who’s that? Harry! Good ter see yeh, mate. Good ter see yeh. Bin havin’ a cuppa with Olympe, She’s jus’ left. Madame Maxime, o’ course! Dunno what yeh’re talkin’ about, You all righ’? No, yeh’re not, ’Course yeh’re not. But yeh will be. Knew he was goin’ ter come back, Known it fer years, Harry. Knew he was out there, bidin’ his time. It had ter happen. Well, now it has, an’ we’ll jus’ have ter get on with it. We’ll fight. Migh’ be able ter stop him before he gets a good hold. That’s Dumbledore’s plan, anyway. Great man, Dumbledore. ’S long as we’ve got him, I’m not too worried. No good sittin’ worryin’ abou’ it, What’s comin’ will come, an’ we’ll meet it when it does. Dumbledore told me wha’ you did, Harry. Yeh did as much as yer father would’ve done, an’ I can’ give yeh no higher praise than that. Got a little job fer me over the summer, Secret, though. I’m not s’pposed ter talk abou’ it, no, not even ter you lot. Olympe — Madame Maxime ter you — might be comin’ with me. I think she will. Think I got her persuaded. Migh’ be, Now . . . who’d like ter come an’ visit the las’ skrewt with me? I was jokin’ — jokin’! “Beauties, aren’ they, eh, Harry? We’ll be studyin’ weapons this term. …” Yeh get a lot o’ funny folk in the Hog’s Head, “Shoulda known!” Bin home three seconds . . . Out the way, Fang . . . Out the way, yeh dozy dog . . . Merlin’s beard, keep it down! Under that Cloak, are yeh? get in, get in! It’s nuthin’, it’s nuthin’! Told yeh, nuthin’, Want a cuppa? I’m tellin’ yeh, I’m fine, Blimey, it’s good ter see you three again — had good summers, did yeh? Fer the las’ time, it’s nuthin’! I’m dealin’ with it, all righ’? It’s s’posed ter look like that, it’s dragon meat, An’ I didn’ get it ter eat. Tha’s better. It helps with the stingin’ Can’, Harry. Top secret. More’n me job’s worth ter tell yeh that. Giants? Who said anythin’ abou’ giants? Who yeh bin talkin’ to? Who’s told yeh what I’ve — who’s said I’ve bin — eh? Oh, yeh did, did yeh? Never known kids like you three fer knowin’ more’n yeh oughta, An’ I’m not complimentin’ yeh, neither. Nosy, some’d call it. Interferin’. Yeah, all righ’, I have. they’re not that difficult ter find, ter be honest Pretty big, see. Mountains, They do, O’ny their deaths are always put down ter mountaineerin’ accidents, aren’ they? Whadda yeh mean, attacked by dementors? I don’ know anything that’s been happenin’ since I left. I was on a secret mission, wasn’ I, didn’ wan’ owls followin’ me all over the place — ruddy dementors! Yeh’re not serious? WHAT? You were expelled? Oh, all righ’, Yeah, tha’s right, Yeah, it was jus’ the pair of us. An’ I’ll tell yeh this, she’s not afraid of roughin’ it, Olympe. Dumbledore knew, an’ he told us, Not really, It’s jus’ that mos’ wizards aren’ bothered where they are, s’ long as it’s a good long way away. Took us abou’ a month ter get there — We’re bein’ watched, Ron, Yeh don’ understand, The Ministry’s keepin’ an eye on Dumbledore an’ anyone they reckon’s in league with him, an’ — Well, not exactly all the way, We jus’ had ter be careful, ’cause Olympe an’ me, we stick out a bit — — so we’re not hard ter follow. We was pretendin’ we was goin’ on holiday together, so we got inter France an’ we made like we was headin’ fer where Olympe’s school is, ’cause we knew we was bein’ tailed by someone from the Ministry. We had to go slow, ’cause I’m not really s’posed ter use magic an’ we knew the Ministry’d be lookin’ fer a reason ter run us in. But we managed ter give the berk tailin’ us the slip round abou’ Dee-John — We chanced a bit o’ magic after that, and it wasn’ a bad journey. Ran inter a couple o’ mad trolls on the Polish border, an’ I had a sligh’ disagreement with a vampire in a pub in Minsk, but apart from tha’, couldn’t’a bin smoother. An’ then we reached the place, an’ we started trekkin’ up through the mountains, lookin’ fer signs of ’em . . . We had ter lay off the magic once we got near ’em. Told us ter be very careful of drawin’ attention ter ourselves as we got nearer in case there was Death Eaters around. Found ’em, Went over a ridge one nigh’ an’ there they was, spread ou’ underneath us. Little fires burnin’ below an’ huge shadows . . . It was like watchin’ bits o’ the mountain movin’. ’Bout twenty feet, Some o’ the bigger ones mighta bin twenty-five. I reckon abou’ seventy or eighty, Yep, eighty left, an’ there was loads once, musta bin a hundred diff’rent tribes from all over the world. But they’ve bin dyin’ out fer ages. Wizards killed a few, o’ course, but mostly they killed each other, an’ now they’re dyin’ out faster than ever. They’re not made ter live bunched up together like tha’. Dumbledore says it’s our fault, it was the wizards who forced ’em to go an’ made ’em live a good long way from us an’ they had no choice but ter stick together fer their own protection. Well, Dumbledore’d told us how ter do it, Give the Gurg gifts, show some respect Oh, the Gurg — means the chief. No problem, he said. He was the biggest, the ugliest, an’ the laziest. Sittin’ there waitin’ ter be brought food by the others. Dead goats an’ such like. Name o’ Karkus. I’d put him at twenty-two, twenty-three feet, an’ the weight of a couple o’ bull elephants. Skin like rhino hide an’ all. Well . . . down ter him, where he was lyin’ in the valley. Olympe an’ I went down the mountainside — It was def’nitely on some of their minds, but we did what Dumbledore told us ter do, which was ter hold our gift up high an’ keep our eyes on the Gurg an’ ignore the others. So tha’s what we did. An’ the rest of ’em went quiet an’ watched us pass an’ we got right up ter Karkus’s feet an’ we bowed an’ put our present down in front o’ him. Nah, he can get food all righ’ fer himself, We took him magic. Giants like magic, jus’ don’t like us usin’ it against ’em. Anyway, that firs’ day we gave him a branch o’ Gubraithian fire. Well anyway, Nothin’, Didn’ speak English. Didn’ matter, Dumbledore had warned us tha’ migh’ happen. Karkus knew enough to yell fer a couple o’ giants who knew our lingo an’ they translated fer us. Oh yeah, it went down a storm once they understood what it was, Very pleased. Well anyway, Oh yeah. Firs’ we presented him with a nice battle helmet — goblin-made an’ indestructible, yeh know — an’ then we sat down an’ we talked. Not much. Listened mostly. But there were good signs. He’d heard o’ Dumbledore, heard he’d argued against the killin’ of the last giants in Britain. Karkus seemed ter be quite int’rested in what Dumbledore had ter say. An’ a few o’ the others, ’specially the ones who had some English, they gathered round an’ listened too. We were hopeful when we left that day. Promised ter come back next day with another present. Well, like I say, they’re not meant ter live together, giants, That night a fight broke out, we saw it from the mouth of our cave, lookin’ down on the valley. Went on fer hours, yeh wouldn’ believe the noise. An’ when the sun came up the snow was scarlet an’ his head was lyin’ at the bottom o’ the lake. Karkus’s, There was a new Gurg, Golgomath. ’Course we did, we hadn’ gone all that way ter give up after two days! We wen’ down with the next present we’d meant ter give ter Karkus.  He was sitting there wearin’ Karkus’s helmet, leerin’ at us as we got nearer. He’s massive, one o’ the biggest ones there. Black hair an’ matchin’ teeth an’ a necklace o’ bones. Human-lookin’ bones, some of ’em. Well, I gave it a go — held out a great roll o’ dragon skin — an’ said Wouldn’ta done if Olympe hadn’ bin there, She pulled out her wand an’ did some o’ the fastes’ spellwork I’ve ever seen. Ruddy marvelous. Hit the two holdin’ me right in the eyes with Conjunctivitus Curses an’ they dropped me straightaway — bu’ we were in trouble then, ’cause we’d used magic against ’em, an’ that’s what giants hate abou’ wizards. We had ter leg it an’ we knew there was no way we was going ter be able ter march inter camp again. We didn’ leave after three days! Dumbledore was relyin’ on us! Not by daylight, we couldn’, no. We just had ter rethink a bit. Spent a couple o’ days lyin’ low up in the cave an’ watchin’. An’ wha’ we saw wasn’ good. No, I wish he had. I mean we soon found out he didn’ object ter all wizards — just us. Yeah, tha’s right, Couple of ’em were visitin’ him ev’ry day, bringin’ gifts ter the Gurg, an’ he wasn’ dangling them upside down. Because I recognized one of ’em, Macnair, remember him? Bloke they sent ter kill Buckbeak? Maniac, he is. Likes killin’ as much as Golgomath, no wonder they were gettin’ on so well. Hold yer hippogriffs, I haven’ finished me story yet! Me an’ Olympe talked it over an’ we agreed, jus’ ’cause the Gurg looked like favorin’ You-Know-Who didn’ mean all of ’em would. We had ter try an’ persuade some o’ the others, the ones who hadn’ wanted Golgomath as Gurg. Well, they were the ones bein’ beaten to a pulp, weren’ they? The ones with any sense were keepin’ outta Golgomath’s way, hidin’ out in caves roun’ the gully jus’ like we were. So we decided we’d go pokin’ round the caves by night an’ see if we couldn’ persuade a few o’ them. Well, it wasn’ the giants who worried us most, We were more concerned abou’ the Death Eaters. At night when the giants were sleepin’ an’ we wanted ter be creepin’ inter the caves, Macnair an’ the other one were sneakin’ round the mountains lookin’ fer us. I was hard put to stop Olympe jumpin’ out at them, She was rarin’ ter attack ’em. . . . She’s somethin’ when she’s roused, Olympe. . . . Fiery, yeh know . . . ’spect it’s the French in her . . . WHAT? Oh . . . oh yeah, we did. Yeah, on the third night after Karkus was killed, we crept outta the cave we’d bin hidin’ in and headed back down inter the gully, keepin’ our eyes skinned fer the Death Eaters. Got inside a few o’ the caves, no go — then, in abou’ the sixth one, we found three giants hidin’. Wasn’ room ter swing a kneazle, Well anyway, Golgomath’s lot raided the caves. The ones tha’ survived didn’ wan’ no more ter to do with us after that. Nope, but we did wha’ we meant ter do, we gave ’em Dumbledore’s message an’ some o’ them heard it an’ I ’spect some o’ them’ll remember it. Jus’ maybe, them that don’ want ter stay around Golgomath’ll move outta the mountains, an’ there’s gotta be a chance they’ll remember Dumbledore’s friendly to ’em. . . . Could be they’ll come . . . Mmm? Dead, Died years ago. They told me. I haven’ bin attacked! She’s goin’ back ter the castle, Blimey . . . inspectin’ people, is she? Oh, don’ you worry abou’ that, I’ve got a great load o’ lessons planned, I’m not sayin’, I don’ want ter spoil the surprise. Dangerous? Don’ be silly, I wouldn’ give yeh anythin’ dangerous! I mean, all righ’, they can look after themselves — But tha’s not very interestin’, Hermione, The stuff I’ve got’s much more impressive, I’ve bin bringin’ ’em on fer years, I reckon I’ve got the on’y domestic herd in Britain — Lis’en, it’s bin a long day an’ it’s late, Look, don’ you go worryin’ abou’ me, I promise yeh I’ve got really good stuff planned fer yer lessons now I’m back. . . . Now you lot had better get back up to the castle, an’ don’ forget ter wipe yer footprints out behind yeh! Gather roun’, gather roun’, Now, they’ll be attracted by the smell o’ the meat but I’m goin’ ter give ’em a call anyway, ’cause they’ll like ter know it’s me . . . Oh, an’ here comes another one! Now . . . put yer hands up, who can see ’em? Yeah . . . yeah, I knew you’d be able ter, Harry, An’ you too, Neville, eh? An’ — Thestrals, Now, who knows — ? No, no, no, tha’s jus’ superstition, that is, they aren’ unlucky, they’re dead clever an’ useful! ’Course, this lot don’ get a lot o’ work, it’s mainly jus’ pullin’ the school carriages unless Dumbledore’s takin’ a long journey an’ don’ want ter Apparate — an’ here’s another couple, look — Don’ worry, it won’ hurt yeh, Righ’, now, who can tell me why some o’ you can see them an’ some can’t? Go on then, Tha’s exactly right, ten points ter Gryffindor. Now, thestrals — Oh hello! Now, thestrals — Glad yeh found the place all righ’! Well, as you can see — or, I dunno — can you? We’re doin’ thestrals today — Er — thestrals! Big — er — winged horses, yeh know! Well . . .  Erm . . . what was I sayin’? Oh yeah, Yeah, I was gonna tell yeh how come we got a herd. Yeah, so, we started off with a male an’ five females. This one, name o’ Tenebrus, he’s my special favorite, firs’ one born here in the forest — Thestrals aren’ dangerous! All righ’, they might take a bite outta you if yeh really annoy them — No — come on! I mean, a dog’ll bite if yeh bait it, won’ it — but thestrals have jus’ got a bad reputation because o’ the death thing — people used ter think they were bad omens, didn’ they? Jus’ didn’ understand, did they? Thestrals, so — thestrals. Yeah. Well, there’s loads o’ good stuff abou’ them . . . Tha’s exactly right, Well, once they’re tamed, like this lot, yeh’ll never be lost again. ’Mazin’ senses o’ direction, jus’ tell ’em where yeh want ter go — All righ’, you two? Fine, fine, Jus’ busy, yeh know, usual stuff — lessons ter prepare — couple o’ salamanders got scale rot — an’ I’m on probation, Yeah, ’S’no more’n I expected, ter tell yeh the truth. Yeh migh’ not’ve picked up on it, bu’ that inspection didn’ go too well, yeh know . . . anyway, Bes’ go an rub a bit more chili powder on them salamanders or their tails’ll be hangin’ off ’em next. See yeh, Harry . . . Ron . . . If she catches yeh, it’ll be all of our necks on the line, Harry, You all righ’? Harry, Oh yeah, I’m grand, Harry, grand . . . In the same boat, you an’ me, aren’ we, Harry? Yeah . . . I’ve said it before. . . . Both outsiders, like, An’ both orphans. Yeah . . . both orphans. Makes a diff’rence, havin’ a decent family, Me dad was decent. An’ your mum an’ dad were decent. If they’d lived, life woulda bin diff’rent, eh? Family, Whatever yeh say, blood’s important . . . Eh? Wha’ injuries? Harry, I got a rough job. I’ll be seein’ yeh, Harry. . . . Take care now . . . Nice bloke, Firenze, but he don’ know what he’s talkin’ abou’ on this. The attemp’s comin’ on fine. There’s things more importan’ than keepin’ a job, Don’ worry abou’ me, Harry, jus’ get along now, there’s a good lad . . . Harry, Hermione . . . Listen, can yeh come with me? Now? While ev’ryone’s watchin’ the match? Harry, No, Harry, it’s gotta be now . . . while ev’ryone’s lookin’ the other way. . . . Please? I ’ppreciate this, you two, I really do, I jus’ hope she doesn’ notice us goin’ . . . Yeah, well, a bit o’ trouble wouldn’ hurt, Give us more time . . . Yeh — yeh’ll see in a mo’, Good . . . good . . . Tha’s good . . . We’re goin’ in here, Yeah, C’mon now, quick, before we’re spotted! Jus’ a precaution, Nah, well, we weren’ goin’ in so far then, An’ anyway, tha’ was before Firenze left the forest, wasn’ it? ’Cause the other centaurs are good an’ riled at me, tha’s why, Not anymore . . . Yeah, Well, angry doesn’ cover it. Ruddy livid. If I hadn’ stepped in, I reckon they’d’ve kicked Firenze ter death — Yeah, ’Course I did, couldn’t stand by an’ watch ’em kill him, could I? Lucky I was passin’, really . . . an’ I’d’ve thought Firenze mighta remembered tha’ before he started sendin’ me stupid warnin’s! Anyway, since then the other centaurs’ve bin livid with me an’ the trouble is, they’ve got a lot of influence in the forest. . . . Cleverest creatures in here . . . Ah no, no, it’s not them. . . . Well, o’ course, they could complicate the problem, yeah. . . . But yeh’ll see what I mean in a bit . . . Bit further, C’mon, Harry. . . . We need ter keep together now . . . Righ’, Maybe we bes’ jus’ stop fer a momen’, so I can . . . fill yeh in, Before we ge’ there, like. Righ’, Well . . . see . . . the thing is . . . Well, there’s a good chance I’m goin’ ter be gettin’ the sack any day now, Umbridge reckons it was me that put tha’ niffler in her office. No, it ruddy well wasn’! On’y anythin’ ter do with magical creatures an’ she thinks it’s got somethin’ ter do with me. Yeh know she’s bin lookin’ fer a chance ter get rid of me ever since I got back. I don’ wan’ ter go, o’ course, but if it wasn’ fer . . . well . . . the special circumstances I’m abou’ ter explain to yeh, I’d leave righ’ now, before she’s go’ the chance ter do it in front o’ the whole school, like she did with Trelawney. It’s not the end o’ the world, I’ll be able ter help Dumbledore once I’m outta here, I can be useful ter the Order. An’ you lot’ll have Grubbly-Plank, yeh’ll — yeh’ll get through yer exams fine . . . Don’ worry abou’ me, Look, I wouldn’ be tellin’ yer this at all if I didn’ have ter. See, if I go . . . well, I can’ leave withou’ . . . withou’ tellin’ someone . . . because I’ll — I’ll need you two ter help me. An’ Ron, if he’s willin’. I knew yeh’d say yes, but I won’ . . . never . . . forget . . . Well . . . c’mon . . . jus’ a little bit further through here . . . Watch yerselves, now, there’s nettles . . . Really easy, Very quiet, now . . . Sleepin’, Well — no — he didn’ want ter come, But I had ter bring him, Hermione, I had ter! I knew if I jus’ got him back, an’ — an’ taught him a few manners — I’d be able ter take him outside an’ show ev’ryone he’s harmless! He don’ know his own strength! An’ he’s gettin’ better, he’s not fightin’ so much anymore — They were all bullyin’ him, Hermione, ’cause he’s so small! Hermione, I couldn’ leave him, See — he’s my brother! Well — half-brother, Turns out me mother took up with another giant when she left me dad, an’ she went an’ had Grawp here — Anyway, He don’ speak a lot of English. . . . I’ve bin tryin’ ter teach him. . . . Anyway, she don’ seem ter have liked him much more’n she liked me. . . . See, with giantesses, what counts is producin’ good big kids, and he’s always been a bit on the runty side fer a giant — on’y sixteen foot — He was bein’ kicked around by all o’ them — I jus’ couldn’ leave him — She — well, she could see it was right importan’ ter me, Bu’ — bu’ she got a bit tired of him after a while, I must admit . . . so we split up on the journey home. . . . She promised not ter tell anyone though . . . Well, tha’s why it took so long, see, Could on’y travel by nigh’ an’ through wild country an’ stuff. Well, now — ‘violent’ — tha’s a bit harsh, I’ll admit he mighta taken a couple o’ swings at me when he’s bin in a bad mood, but he’s gettin’ better, loads better, settlin’ down well . . . Look after him, After I’m gone. Not food or anythin’! He can get his own food, no problem. Birds an’ deer an’ stuff . . . No, it’s company he needs. If I jus’ knew someone was carryin’ on tryin’ ter help him a bit . . . teachin’ him, yeh know . . . Yeah — even if yeh jus’ talk ter him a bit, ’Cause I reckon, if he can talk ter people, he’ll understand more that we all like him really, an’ want him to stay . . . Yeh’ll do it, then? Harry, An’ I don’ wan’ yeh ter put yerself out too much, like. . . . I know yeh’ve got exams. . . . If yeh could jus’ nip down here in yer Invisibility Cloak maybe once a week an’ have a little chat with him . . . I’ll wake him up, then — introduce you — Grawp? Had a nice sleep, eh? You? I’ve brought some friends ter meet yeh. Remember, I told yeh I might? Remember, when I said I might have ter go on a little trip an’ leave them ter look after yeh fer a bit? Remember that, Grawpy? Now, Grawpy, don’ do that! I got company fer yeh! Company, see! Look down, yeh big buffoon, I brought yeh some friends! Harry, is Harry, Grawp! Harry Potter! He migh’ be comin’ ter visit yeh if I have ter go away, understand? An’ this is Hermione, see? Her — Would yeh mind if he called yeh Hermy, Hermione? On’y it’s a difficult name fer him ter remember . . . This is Hermy, Grawp! An’ she’s gonna be comin’ an’ all! Is’n tha’ nice? Eh? Two friends fer yeh ter — GRAWPY, NO! BAD BOY, GRAWPY! VERY BAD BOY! YEH DON’ GRAB — OUCH! Righ’, Well . . . there yeh are. . . . Yeh’ve met him an’ — an’ now he’ll know yeh when yeh come back. Yeah . . . well . . . Well, I reckon tha’s enough fer one day, We’ll — er — we’ll go back now, shall we? Hold it, Oh blimey, How are yeh, Magorian? ‘This human’ now, am I? Jus’ fer stoppin’ all of yeh committin’ murder? Servitude! If yeh say so, Now, you listen ter me, I’ll have less of the ‘our’ forest, if it’s all the same ter you. It’s not up ter you who comes an’ goes in here — I won’ be kept outta the fores’ by a bunch of mules like you! You’ll tolerate him as long as he’s here, it’s as much his forest as yours! Calm down, you two, Ruddy old nags though, eh? Ah, you heard what they said, They wouldn’t hurt foals — I mean, kids. Was that another goal? Or d’you reckon the match is over? I reckon it’s over, yeh know! Look — there’s people comin’ out already — if you two hurry yeh’ll be able ter blend in with the crowd an’ no one’ll know you weren’t there! All righ’, Harry! Come in, come in, we’ll have a cup o’ dandelion juice. . . . How’s things? You — er — feelin’ all righ’, are yeh? Bin hidin’ out in the mountains, Up in a cave, like Sirius did when he — Anyway, back now, Yes, Oh — oh yeah. Well, Grawpy’s loads better behaved now, loads. Seemed right pleased ter see me when I got back,   He’s a good lad, really.. . . I’ve bin thinkin’ abou’ tryin’ ter find him a lady friend, actually . . . He’s a good lad, really. Ev’ryone knows you’ve bin tellin’ the truth now, Harry, Tha’s gotta be better, hasn’ it? Look . . . I knew Sirius longer ’n you did. . . . He died in battle, an’ tha’s the way he’d’ve wanted ter go — Nah, I don’ reckon he did, But still, Harry . . . he was never one ter sit around at home an’ let other people do the fightin’.

So how come yeh were late, Harry? I was worried. I was with Grawp, Los’ track o’ the time. He’s got a new home up in the mountains now, Dumbledore fixed it — nice big cave. He’s much happier than he was in the forest. We were havin’ a good chat. Oh yeah, he’s really come on, Yeh’ll be amazed. I’m thinkin’ o’ trainin’ him up as me assistant. Anyway, I’ll see yeh tomorrow, firs’ lesson’s straight after lunch. Come early an’ yeh can say hello ter Buck — I mean, Witherwings! Oi! Right, He’ll have yer fingers — oh. It’s yeh lot.

All righ’, come in then, yeh ungrateful little . . . Well? What’s this? Feelin’ sorry for me? Reckon I’m lonely or summat? Missed me, have yeh? Yeah. Righ’. Yeah. Righ’, Jus’ giant grubs, They won’ grow inter nuthin’, I got ’em ter feed ter Aragog. It’s . . . him . . . It’s . . . Aragog. . . . I think he’s dyin’. . . .

Ar, I always knew yeh’d find it hard ter squeeze me inter yer timetables, Ar, well then, There’s no way yeh could’ve done it. . . . I’m sorry I’ve bin — yeh know — I’ve jus’ bin worried abou’ Aragog . . . an’ I did wonder whether, if Professor Grubbly-Plank had bin teachin’ yeh — Harry! Jus’ bin visitin’ Grawp, he’s comin’ on so well yeh wouldn’ — Wha’? Wha’? Cursed? Who’s bin cursed — not Ron? Hermione? Get back! Lemme see her! Bin in the forest all day! Aragog’s worse, I bin readin’ to him — didn’ get up ter dinner till jus’ now an’ then Professor Sprout told me abou’ Ron! How is he? I don’ believe this, Jus’ don’ believe it . . . Look at him lyin’ there. . . . Who’d want ter hurt him, eh? Someone couldn’ have a grudge against the Gryffindor Quidditch team, could they? Firs’ Katie, now Ron . . . It’s terrible, All this new security, an’ kids are still gettin’ hurt. . . . Dumbledore’s worried sick. . . . He don’ say much, but I can tell. . . . I ’spect he’s got hundreds of ideas, brain like his, But he doesn’ know who sent that necklace nor put poison in that wine, or they’d’ve bin caught, wouldn’ they? Wha’ worries me, is how long Hogwarts can stay open if kids are bein’ attacked. Chamber o’ Secrets all over again, isn’ it? There’ll be panic, more parents takin’ their kids outta school, an’ nex’ thing yeh know the board o’ governors . . . . . . the board o’ governors’ll be talkin’ about shuttin’ us up fer good. Gotta see it from their point o’ view, I mean, it’s always bin a bit of a risk sendin’ a kid ter Hogwarts, hasn’ it? Yer expect accidents, don’ yeh, with hundreds of underage wizards all locked up tergether,   but attempted murder, tha’s diff’rent.’S’no wonder Dumbledore’s angry with Sn — I never said tha’, Look at the time, it’s gettin’ on fer midnight, I need ter — Shhhh! Don’ shout stuff like that, Harry, d’yeh wan’ me ter lose me job? Mind, I don’ suppose yeh’d care, would yeh, not now yeh’ve given up Care of Mag — No idea, I — well, I was comin’ outta the forest the other evenin’ an’ I overheard ’em talking — well, arguin’. Didn’t like ter draw attention to meself, so I sorta skulked an’ tried not ter listen, but it was a — well, a heated discussion an’ it wasn’ easy ter block it out. Of course, No idea, Pretty firm with him. An’ then he said summat abou’ Snape makin’ investigations in his House, in Slytherin. Well, there’s nothin’ strange abou’ that! Look, I know what yeh’re like abou’ Snape, Harry, an’ I don’ want yeh ter go readin’ more inter this than there is. No it won’, Filch, They’re with me, aren’ they? Is he? Get goin’, Get goin’, Yeh came, Don’ — don’ matter . . . He’d’ve bin touched yeh’re here, though, Harry. . . . Blimey, no, The other spiders won’ let me anywhere near their webs now Aragog’s gone. Turns out it was on’y on his orders they didn’ eat me! Can yeh believe that, Harry? Never bin an area o’ the forest I couldn’ go before! It wasn’ easy, gettin’ Aragog’s body out o’ there  I can tell yeh — they usually eat their dead, see.. . . But I wanted ter give ’im a nice burial . . . a proper send-off . . . Not in trouble, are yeh? Yeh shouldn’ be outta the castle in the evenin’, I know it, it’s my fault — Did he? Tha’s — tha’s righ’ nice of him, that is, an’ not turnin’ yeh in either. I’ve never really had a lot ter do with Horace Slughorn before. . . . Comin’ ter see old Aragog off, though, eh? Well . . . he’d’ve liked that, Aragog would. . . . Jus’ beyond the pumpkin patch, I thought, I’ve already dug the — yeh know — grave. Jus’ thought we’d say a few nice things over him — happy memories, yeh know — Tha’s very nice of yeh, Thanks a lot. An’ thanks fer not givin’ Harry detention neither. . . . Out here, Shall we — shall we do it, then? It’s not ev’ryone appreciates how beau’iful they are, I didn’ know yeh were int’rested in creatures like Aragog, Horace. Tha’ was . . . tha’ was . . . beau’iful!

That’s never unicorn hair Gets pulled out of their tails, they catch it on branches an’ stuff in the forest I use it fer bindin’ on bandages an’ stuff if a creature gets injured, It’s dead useful . . . very strong, see.

I was bindin’ up a couple o’ bowtruckle legs when I heard ’em comin’, They’ll’ve bin burnt ter twigs, poor little things. . . . But what happened, Harry? I jus’ saw them Death Eaters runnin’ down from the castle, but what the ruddy hell was Snape doin’ with ’em? Where’s he gone — was he chasin’ them? Killed? Snape killed? What’re yeh on abou’, Harry? Dumbledore wha’, Harry? Don’ say that, Snape kill Dumbledore — don’ be stupid, Harry. Wha’s made yeh say tha’? Yeh couldn’ have. What musta happened was, Dumbledore musta told Snape ter go with them Death Eaters, I suppose he’s gotta keep his cover. Look, let’s get yeh back up ter the school. Come on, Harry. . . . C’mere, Harry . . . Yeh can’ stay here, Harry. . . . Come on, now. . . . Harry, come on. I’ve . . . I’ve done it, Professor, M-moved him. Professor Sprout’s got the kids back in bed. Professor Flitwick’s lyin’ down, but he says he’ll be all righ’ in a jiffy, an’ Professor Slughorn says the Ministry’s bin informed. I dunno, Professor . . . that’s fer the Heads of House an’ the headmistress ter decide . . . Well, I’m stayin’, It’s me home, it’s bin me home since I was thirteen. An’ if there’s kids who wan’ me ter teach ’em, I’ll do it. But . . . I dunno . . . Hogwarts without Dumbledore . . . No other headmaster or headmistress ever gave more to this school, I suppose . . . yes . . . Here, An’ you’re with me, Harry. That all righ’? We’ll be on the bike, brooms an’ thestrals can’t take me weight, see. Not a lot o’ room on the seat with me on it, though, so you’ll be in the sidecar. The very same, An’ the last time yeh was on it, Harry, I could fit yeh in one hand! Arthur’s done a bit o’ tinkerin’, It’s got a few tricks up its handlebars now. Tha’ one was my idea. My job’s ter get you there safe, Harry! Hold on, Harry, this’ll do for ’em! Here we go again, Harry, hold on! This’ll do it, Harry, hold on tight! It’s all righ’, Harry! I’m on it, Harry, don’ worry! I’m comin’, Harry! I’m comin’, Harry, I’m comin’! Harry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry, Harry, what’s happened? Where’ve they gone? Hold on tight, then, Harry! I think we’ve lost ’em Harry, I think we’ve done it! We’re nearly there, Harry, we’ve nearly made it! No! Harry! Blimey, Harry, how did yeh get out o’ that? I thought we were both goners. Wait a moment, Harry, where’s Hedwig? Never mind, Never mind. She had a great old life — Haven’t go’ any brandy, have yeh, Molly? Fer medicinal purposes? Harry, give us a hand! Mad-Eye. Mad-Eye, Mad-Eye, Yer not goin’ anywhere, Blimey, Harry, after all we wen’ through ter get you here? Wait till it gets out yeh did it again, Harry, Seventeen, eh!

Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back. “She won’t wake,” It won’t come until it is called, You won’t be needing it, For the chance to see you. To speak to you. We’re going to talk now, Well, that’s an interesting question, And quite a long story. I suppose the real reason Ginny Weasley’s like this is because she opened her heart and spilled all her secrets to an invisible stranger. The diary, “My diary. how she didn’t think famous, good, great Harry Potter would ever like her. . . . The diary, But I was patient. I wrote back. I was sympathetic, I was kind. Ginny simply loved me.  No one’s ever understood me like you, Tom. . . . I’m so glad I’ve got this diary to confide in. . . . It’s like having a friend I can carry around in my pocket. . . . If I say it myself, Harry, I’ve always been able to charm the people I needed. So Ginny poured out her soul to me, and her soul happened to be exactly what I wanted. . . . I grew stronger and stronger on a diet of her deepest fears, her darkest secrets. I grew powerful, far more powerful than little Miss Weasley. Powerful enough to start feeding Miss Weasley a few of my secrets, to start pouring a little of my soul back into her . . . Haven’t you guessed yet, Harry Potter? Ginny Weasley opened the Chamber of Secrets. She strangled the school roosters and daubed threatening messages on the walls. She set the serpent of Slytherin on four Mudbloods, and the Squib’s cat. Yes, Of course, she didn’t know what she was doing at first. It was very amusing. I wish you could have seen her new diary entries . . . far more interesting, they became. . . . Dear Tom, I think I’m losing my memory. There are rooster feathers all over my robes and I don’t know how they got there. Dear Tom, I can’t remember what I did on the night of Halloween, but a cat was attacked and I’ve got paint all down my front. Dear Tom, Percy keeps telling me I’m pale and I’m not myself. I think he suspects me. . . . There was another attack today and I don’t know where I was. Tom, what am I going to do? I think I’m going mad. . . . I think I’m the one attacking everyone, Tom! The diary, But she finally became suspicious and tried to dispose of it. And that’s where you came in, Harry. You found it, and I couldn’t have been more delighted. Of all the people who could have picked it up, it was you, the very person I was most anxious to meet. . . . Well, you see, Ginny told me all about you, Harry, Your whole fascinating history. I knew I must find out more about you, talk to you, meet you if I could. So I decided to show you my famous capture of that great oaf, Hagrid, to gain your trust — It was my word against Hagrid’s, Harry. Well, you can imagine how it looked to old Armando Dippet. On the one hand, Tom Riddle, poor but brilliant, parentless but so brave, school prefect, model student . . . but I admit, even I was surprised how well the plan worked. I thought someone must realize that Hagrid couldn’t possibly be the Heir of Slytherin. It had taken me five whole years to find out everything I could about the Chamber of Secrets and discover the secret entrance . . . as though Hagrid had the brains, or the power! Only the Transfiguration teacher, Dumbledore, seemed to think Hagrid was innocent. He persuaded Dippet to keep Hagrid and train him as gamekeeper. Yes, I think Dumbledore might have guessed. . . . Dumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the other teachers did. . . . The diary, I knew it wouldn’t be safe to open the Chamber again while I was still at school. But I wasn’t going to waste those long years I’d spent searching for it. I decided to leave behind a diary, preserving my sixteen-year-old self in its pages, so that one day, with luck, I would be able to lead another in my footsteps, and finish Salazar Slytherin’s noble work. Imagine how angry I was when the next time my diary was opened, it was Ginny who was writing to me, not you. She saw you with the diary, you see, and panicked. What if you found out how to work it, and I repeated all her secrets to you? What if, even worse, I told you who’d been strangling roosters? So the foolish little brat waited until your dormitory was deserted and stole it back. But I knew what I must do. It was clear to me that you were on the trail of Slytherin’s heir. From everything Ginny had told me about you, I knew you would go to any lengths to solve the mystery — particularly if one of your best friends was attacked. And Ginny had told me the whole school was buzzing because you could speak Parseltongue. . . . The diary, “Not what? “Dumbledore’s been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me!” “That’s a phoenix. . . .” “And that — ” “that’s the old school Sorting Hat —” “Speak to me, Slytherin, greatest of the Hogwarts Four.” “Kill him.” What? Will you be wanting anything? Beer? Brandy? If you’ll follow me, Mr. Potter, I’ve already taken your things up. . . . Very smart owl you’ve got there, Arrived about five minutes after you did. If there’s anything you need, Mr. Potter, don’t hesitate to ask. Madam Lestrange,",

A foolish young man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it. . . . Since then, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times. He has had to be very hard on me. He does not forgive mistakes easily. When I failed to steal the Stone from Gringotts, he was most displeased.

You buried the elf, I watched you from the window of the bedroom next door. You are an unusual wizard, Harry Potter. You dug the grave. You also rescued a goblin. You brought me here. Saved me. No, Harry Potter, but you are a very odd wizard. Break into a Gringotts vault? It is impossible. The vault in question was empty at the time, Its protection was minimal. You have no chance, No chance at all. If you seek beneath our floors, a treasure that was never yours — If there was a wizard of whom I would believe that they did not seek personal gain, it would be you, Harry Potter. Goblins and elves are not used to the protection or the respect that you have shown this night. Not from wand-carriers. The right to carry a wand, has long been contested between wizards and goblins. That is immaterial! Wizards refuse to share the secrets of wandlore with other magical beings, they deny us the possibility of extending our powers! But it is, it is about precisely that! As the Dark Lord becomes ever more powerful, your race is set still more firmly above mine! Gringotts falls under Wizarding rule, house-elves are slaughtered, and who amongst the wand-carriers protests? What? The sword that lies inside it is a fake. This is the real one. I think that you already know this. You asked me to lie for you back there. It is against our code to speak of the secrets of Gringotts. We are the guardians of fabulous treasures. We have a duty to the objects placed in our care, which were, so often, wrought by our fingers. So young, to be fighting so many. I shall . . . think about it, I think, that the Skele-Gro has finished its work. I may be able to sleep at last. Forgive me. . . . I have reached my decision, Harry Potter, Though the goblins of Gringotts will consider it base treachery, I have decided to help you — — in return, for payment. Not gold, I have gold. I want the sword. The sword of Godric Gryffindor. Then, we have a problem. I am not a thief, boy! I am not trying to procure treasures to which I have no right! It is not, And before it was Gryffindor’s, whose was it? No! Wizarding arrogance again! That sword was Ragnuk the First’s, taken from him by Godric Gryffindor! It is a lost treasure, a masterpiece of goblinwork! It belongs with the goblins! The sword is the price of my hire, take it or leave it! I have your word, Harry Potter, that you will give me the sword of Gryffindor if I help you? Then shake, Then, I have visited the Lestranges’ vault only once, on the occasion I was told to place inside it the false sword. It is one of the most ancient chambers. The oldest Wizarding families store their treasures at the deepest level, where the vaults are largest and best protected. . . . Moonstones and diamonds, Made by goblins, I think? They know! They must have been warned there might be an impostor! Act now, act now, the Imperius Curse! Good! So, we need Bogrod to control the cart; I no longer have the authority. But there will not be room for the wizard. No! The Thief’s Downfall! We need him, we cannot enter the vault without a Gringotts goblin. And we need the Clankers! Not far, Harry Potter, not far . . . It is partially blind, It has learned what to expect when the Clankers come. Give them to me. You know what to do, It will expect pain when it hears the noise: It will retreat, and Bogrod must place his palm upon the door of the vault. Make him press his hand to the door! No matter, Bogrod will be able to release us! Light your wands, can’t you? And hurry, we have very little time! They have added Gemino and Flagrante Curses! Everything you touch will burn and multiply, but the copies are worthless — and if you continue to handle the treasure, you will eventually be crushed to death by the weight of expanding gold! No use, no use! There! Aargh! Thieves! Help! Thieves!",

Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father favored it — it’s really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course.” Oh, Yew Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled?” But you don’t use them?” All right, Oh, Oh, “Curious . . . curious . . .” I remember every wand I’ve ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather — just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother — why, its brother gave you that scar. Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember. . . . I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potter. . . . After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things — terrible, yes, but great. Come in! My dear boy. You rescued us. I thought we would die in that place. I can never thank you . . . never thank you . . . enough. Anything. Anything, Holly and phoenix feather, Eleven inches. Nice and supple. No, Walnut and dragon heartstring, Twelve-and-three-quarter inches. Unyielding. This wand belonged to Bellatrix Lestrange. Hawthorn and unicorn hair. Ten inches precisely. Reasonably springy. This was the wand of Draco Malfoy. Perhaps not. If you took it — — then it may be yours. Of course, the manner of taking matters. Much also depends upon the wand itself. In general, however, where a wand has been won, its allegiance will change. The wand chooses the wizard, That much has always been clear to those of us who have studied wandlore. Yeah, The best results, however, must always come where there is the strongest affinity between wizard and wand. These connections are complex. An initial attraction, and then a mutual quest for experience, the wand learning from the wizard, the wizard from the wand. I think so. Subtle laws govern wand ownership, but the conquered wand will usually bend its will to its new master. Chestnut and dragon heartstring. Nine-and-a-quarter inches. Brittle. I was forced to make this shortly after my kidnapping, for Peter Pettigrew. Yes, if you won it, it is more likely to do your bidding, and do it well, than another wand. Yeah, You ask deep questions, Mr. Potter. Wandlore is a complex and mysterious branch of magic. Necessary? No, I should not say that it is necessary to kill. Only one wand, I think, I — how? How do you know this? He tortured me, you must understand that! The Cruciatus Curse, I — I had no choice but to tell him what I knew, what I guessed! I had . . . never heard of such a thing. Your wand performed something unique that night. The connection of the twin cores is incredibly rare, yet why your wand should have snapped the borrowed wand, I do not know. . . . How do you know this? Yeah, He wanted to know everything I could tell him about the wand variously known as the Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny, or the Elder Wand. The Dark Lord, had always been happy with the wand I made him — yew and phoenix feather, thirteen-and-a-half inches — until he discovered the connection of the twin cores. Now he seeks another, more powerful wand, as the only way to conquer yours. The Dark Lord no longer seeks the Elder Wand only for your destruction, Mr. Potter. He is determined to possess it because he believes it will make him truly invulnerable. The owner of the Elder Wand must always fear attack, but the idea of the Dark Lord in possession of the Deathstick is, I must admit . . . formidable. Yes, There are gaps, of course, and long ones, where it vanishes from view, temporarily lost or hidden; but always it resurfaces. It has certain identifying characteristics that those who are learned in wandlore recognize. There are written accounts, some of them obscure, that I and other wandmakers have made it our business to study. They have the ring of authenticity. No, Whether it needs to pass by murder, I do not know. Its history is bloody, but that may be simply due to the fact that it is such a desirable object, and arouses such passions in wizards. Immensely powerful, dangerous in the wrong hands, and an object of incredible fascination to all of us who study the power of wands. It was a rumor, A rumor, years and years ago, long before you were born! I believe Gregorovitch himself started it. You can see how good it would be for business: that he was studying and duplicating the qualities of the Elder Wand! What? I’m afraid I don’t know what you’re talking about. Is this still something to do with wands? He was torturing me! The Cruciatus Curse . . . you have no idea. . . . And I you, my dear, You were an inexpressible comfort to me in that terrible place. It will be an honor, the very least I can do in return for your generous hospitality.",

I was looking for Ron — Fred! We’ve been hearing explosions out of their room for ages, but we never thought they were actually making things, We thought they just liked the noise. And then there was this big row, because Mum wants them to go into the Ministry of Magic like Dad, and they told her all they want to do is open a joke shop. Because he’s being stupid, Its proper name is Pigwidgeon. Why do we have to be up so early? I thought Mr. Bagman was Head of Magical Games and Sports, He should know better than to talk about Bludgers near Muggles, shouldn’t he? He — er — just asked Fleur Delacour to go to the ball with him, Don’t! Because — oh shut up laughing, you two — because they’ve both just been turned down by girls they asked to the ball! Nope, I’m not telling you, it’s her business, I can’t, I’m going with — with Neville. He asked me when Hermione said no, and I thought . . . well . . . I’m not going to be able to go otherwise, I’m not in fourth year. I think I’ll go and have dinner, HARRY! I thought I heard your voice. It’s no go with the Extendable Ears, she’s gone and put an Imperturbable Charm on the kitchen door. Tonks told me how to find out, You just chuck stuff at the door and if it can’t make contact the door’s been Imperturbed. I’ve been flicking Dungbombs at it from the top of the stairs and they just soar away from it, so there’s no way the Extendable Ears will be able to get under the gap. Bill doesn’t like him either, It’s been awful, We know, Harry, Crookshanks, He loves playing with them. Mum, I want to! Come on, if we get a move on we’ll be able to save them places. What are you talking about? There’s room in this one, there’s only Loony Lovegood in here — Don’t be silly, she’s all right. Hi, Luna, Is it okay if we take these seats? Thanks, Had a good summer, Luna? No you’re not, Neville Longbottom — Luna Lovegood. Luna’s in my year, but in Ravenclaw. Never mind, Look, we can get rid of all this easily. Scourgify! I don’t know, but we’d better get out of the way, we’re blocking the door. Hi, Hem, hem, Weren’t we trying to decide how often we’re going to meet and get Defense lessons? I’ll tell Michael, The fool, honestly . . . “Yeah, the D.A.’s good,” Only let’s make it stand for Dumbledore’s Army because that’s the Ministry’s worst fear, isn’t it? How’re you feeling? No, He just got lines, I heard Montague laughing about it at dinner. We’ve got to go to St. Mungo’s, Sirius, can you lend us cloaks or anything — ? Somebody else could have told us. . . . We could have heard it somewhere other than Harry . . . Well, you have! And you won’t look at any of us! Harry, Well, that was a bit stupid of you, seeing as you don’t know anyone but me who’s been possessed by You-Know-Who, and I can tell you how it feels. Lucky you, Well, can you remember everything you’ve been doing? Are there big blank periods where you don’t know what you’ve been up to? What’s this? Then You-Know-Who hasn’t ever possessed you, When he did it to me, I couldn’t remember what I’d been doing for hours at a time. I’d find myself somewhere and not know how I got there. Typical Dad, Stitches . . . I ask you . . . Yes, it was, It was appalling. Angelina was nearly in tears by the end of it. I was lucky, It wasn’t a very fast Snitch and Summerby’s got a cold, he sneezed and closed his eyes at exactly the wrong moment. Anyway, once you’re back on the team — You’re banned as long as Umbridge is in the school, There’s a difference. Anyway, once you’re back, I think I’ll try out for Chaser. Angelina and Alicia are both leaving next year and I prefer goal-scoring to Seeking anyway. Angelina still won’t let him resign, She says she knows he’s got it in him. Harry, I’m talking to you, can you hear me? It’s over, Ron had to take Jack Sloper up to the hospital wing. Well, we’re not sure, but we think he knocked himself out with his own bat. Anyway . . . a package just arrived, it’s only just got through Umbridge’s new screening process . . . It’s Easter eggs from Mum, There’s one for you. . . . There you go . . . Are you okay, Harry? You seem really down lately, You know, I’m sure if you just talked to Cho . . . Who is it, then? Well, if you really want to talk to Sirius, I expect we could think of a way to do it . . . The thing about growing up with Fred and George, is that you sort of start thinking anything’s possible if you’ve got enough nerve. Oh damn, Hi, There’s no need to take that tone with me, I was only wondering whether I could help. Yeah, we’ll do it, Luna and I can stand at either end of the corridor, and warn people not to go down there because someone’s let off a load of Garroting Gas. Fred and George were planning to do it before they left. You can’t come down here! No, sorry, you’re going to have to go round by the swiveling staircase, someone’s let off Garroting Gas just along here — And they left you behind? I’ve got a broom! Excuse me, but I care what happens to Sirius as much as you do! I’m three years older than you were when you fought You-Know-Who over the Sorcerer’s Stone, and it’s because of me Malfoy’s stuck back in Umbridge’s office with giant flying bogeys attacking him — Four, Hermione, Oh, more of them will come, Because in case you hadn’t noticed, you and Hermione are both covered in blood, I think it was to stop us knowing which door we came in from, Are they fish? Oh look! You dawdled enough by that old arch! It’s only my ankle, I can do it myself! Harry, Well, Flitwick’s got rid of Fred and George’s swamp, He did it in about three seconds. But he left a tiny patch under the window and he’s roped it off — Oh, he just says it was a really good bit of magic, Not at all, He’s really, really miserable, actually . . . He keeps saying Umbridge was the best thing that ever happened to Hogwarts . . . Sulking, more like, It looks like he and Trelawney are both going to teach, Michael Corner, Not anymore, Well, I’ve chosen Dean Thomas, would you say he’s better? Wotcher, Harry. Hi, Harry. It’s her, She’s driving me mad. It’s the way she talks to me — you’d think I was about three! Oh, that’s right, defend her, We all know you can’t get enough of her. Mum hates her, Including you and Dad, A cow, But Bill’s not that down-to-earth. You don’t really want her around forever? Well, Mum’s going to put a stop to it if she can, I bet you anything. She keeps trying to get Tonks round for dinner. I think she’s hoping Bill will fall for Tonks instead. I hope he does, I’d much rather have her in the family. She’s a damn sight nicer than Phlegm, I suppose you like the way Phlegm says ‘’Arry,’ do you? I’d much rather have Tonks in the family, At least she’s a laugh. I’m talking to this lot! She only wants me there so she doesn’t have to be alone with Phlegm! You lot had better come down quickly too, It’ll be Fred and George’s idea of a funny joke, making sure it can’t come off, Hermione? How did you do? The wandmaker? But wands — what’ll people do for wands? I wouldn’t go in the kitchen just now, There’s a lot of Phlegm around. I can’t, Harry, I said I’d meet Dean, See you later. He saw me hex Zacharias Smith, He kept on and on asking about what happened at the Ministry and in the end he annoyed me so much I hexed him — when Slughorn came in I thought I was going to get detention, but he just thought it was a really good hex and invited me to lunch! Mad, eh? Hang on, Did I hear right?Harry You’ve been taking orders from something someone wrote in a book, Harry? But you’re doing what it says? Hey, Harry, I’m supposed to give you this. I’m going with Dean — might see you there, Panicked, You prat, Ron, look at the state of her! Well, you seemed too busy to call him a prat and I thought someone should — What? This was a deserted corridor till you came butting in! You go! I want a word with my dear brother! Right, let’s get this straight once and for all. It is none of your business who I go out with or what I do with them, Ron — A what? A what, exactly? Oh yes he does! Just because he’s never snogged anyone in his life, just because the best kiss he’s ever had is from our Auntie Muriel — No, I will not! I’ve seen you with Phlegm, hoping she’ll kiss you on the cheek every time you see her, it’s pathetic! If you went out and got a bit of snogging done yourself, you wouldn’t mind so much that everyone else does it! Been kissing Pigwidgeon, have you? Or have you got a picture of Auntie Muriel stashed under your pillow? Harry’s snogged Cho Chang! And Hermione snogged Viktor Krum, it’s only you who acts like it’s something disgusting, Ron, and that’s because you’ve got about as much experience as a twelve-year-old! Conditions look ideal, And guess what? That Slytherin Chaser Vaisey — he took a Bludger in the head yesterday during their practice, and he’s too sore to play! And even better than that — Malfoy’s gone off sick too! Dunno, They’re playing Harper instead; he’s in my year and he’s an idiot. Forgot to brake, Professor, sorry. Don’t call her that, Ron, I’m really glad you’re taking her, Harry, she’s so excited. Harry, you’ve got a maggot in your hair, Don’t cry, Mum, It’s okay. . . . No, thanks, I said I’d meet Dean, You were in Hogsmeade? Why would Slughorn want to poison Harry? So you think Slughorn’s a Death Eater? Or he could be innocent, The poison could have been in the bottle, in which case it was probably meant for Slughorn himself. But you said Slughorn had been planning to give that bottle to Dumbledore for Christmas, So the poisoner could just as easily have been after Dumbledore. Where have you been? So? Does it matter right now? Don’t push me, please, Dean, You’re always doing that, I can get through perfectly well on my own. . . . Give it a rest, Hermione! By the sound of it, Malfoy was trying to use an Unforgivable Curse, you should be glad Harry had something good up his sleeve! Oh, don’t start acting as though you understand Quidditch, you’ll only embarrass yourself. You’d think people had better things to gossip about, Three dementor attacks in a week, and all Romilda Vane does is ask me if it’s true you’ve got a hippogriff tattooed across your chest. I told her it’s a Hungarian Horntail, Much more macho. A Pygmy Puff, but I didn’t say where. Since when did you give me permission to do anything? Anyway, you said yourself you’d rather it was Harry than Michael or Dean. You filthy hypocrite! Harry, where did you come from? We’re going to the hospital wing, It’s McGonagall’s orders, Everyone’s up there, Ron and Hermione and Lupin and everyone — Don’t worry, none of us. He stepped over Bill, but it’s all right, he’s alive. Of course I’m sure . . . he’s a — a bit of a mess, Greyback attacked him. Madam Pomfrey says he won’t — won’t look the same anymore. . . . We don’t really know what the aftereffects will be — I mean, Greyback being a werewolf, but not transformed at the time. Neville and Professor Flitwick are both hurt, but Madam Pomfrey says they’ll be all right. And a Death Eater’s dead, he got hit by a Killing Curse that huge blond one was firing off everywhere — Harry, if we hadn’t had your Felix potion, I think we’d all have been killed, but everything seemed to just miss us — Ron — Dumbledore’s dead, Shh! Listen! He came out of the room about an hour after we started keeping watch, He was on his own, clutching that awful shriveled arm — Anyway, he must have been checking whether the coast was clear to let the Death Eaters out, because the moment he saw us he threw something into the air and it all went pitch-black — We tried everything, Lumos, Incendio, Nothing would penetrate the darkness; all we could do was grope our way out of the corridor again, and meanwhile we could hear people rushing past us. I saw him running toward us, but that huge Death Eater’s jinx just missed me right afterward and I ducked and lost track of things, I suppose I’m just going to have to accept that he really is going to marry her, Well, I suppose if Mum can stand it, I can. I’m going to go to bed, I haven’t been sleeping that well since . . . well . . . I could do with some sleep. The Portkey, And that one, should have been Dad and Fred’s, they were supposed to be second. You and Hagrid were third and, if they made it, George and Lupin ought to be back in about a minute. Mum! Did I hear someone else in the yard? Thank goodness, Ron and Tonks should be back by now. They didn’t have a long journey; Auntie Muriel’s not that far from here. I think Mum thinks that if she can stop the three of you getting together and planning, she’ll be able to delay you leaving, So it’s true? That’s what you’re trying to do? Harry, will you come in here a moment? Happy seventeenth. I didn’t know what would be useful. Nothing too big, because you wouldn’t be able to take it with you. So then I thought, I’d like you to have something to remember me by, you know, if you meet some veela when you’re off doing whatever you’re doing. There’s the silver lining I’ve been looking for, Well, happy birthday anyway, Harry. No, Luna will take Harry, won’t you, Luna? I won’t! I’m in Dumbledore’s Army — I can’t go home! My whole family’s here, I can’t stand waiting there alone and not knowing and — Fine, I’ll say good-bye now, then, and — They said something about a bathroom, not long after you left. As long as it’s not any of our lot! Tonks, Tonks, I’m sure he’s okay — James, give it a rest! Every day, if you want us to, We wrote to James three times a week last year,",

Guess who we just met on the train? You know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station? Know who he is? “Asked him. Saw his scar. It’s really there — like lightning.” “Never mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who looks like?” All right, keep your hair on. Don’t, Ginny, we’ll send you loads of owls. Hey, Ron. Listen, we’re going down the middle of the train — Lee Jordan’s got a giant tarantula down there. I tell you, we’re going to win that Quidditch Cup for sure this year, We haven’t won since Charlie left, but this year’s team is going to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us. Anyway, we’ve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he’s found a new secret passageway out of the school. All right there, Harry? Tie that around the bars, Don’t worry, and stand back. A lot of wizards think it’s a waste of time, knowing this sort of Muggle trick, but we feel they’re skills worth learning, even if they are a bit slow. Very fishy, Well, put it this way — house-elves have got powerful magic of their own, but they can’t usually use it without their master’s permission. I reckon old Dobby was sent to stop you coming back to Hogwarts. Someone’s idea of a joke. Can you think of anyone at school with a grudge against you? Yes, The owl Mum and Dad bought Percy when he was made prefect, Yeah, Dad’s crazy about everything to do with Muggles; our shed’s full of Muggle stuff. He takes it apart, puts spells on it, and puts it back together again. If he raided our house he’d have to put himself under arrest. It drives Mum mad. Yeah, she’ll be wanting your autograph, Harry, Blimey, I’m tired, Oh, Mum — Mum fancies him, Pitiful, I bet I can get mine beyond that stump. He’ll be all right, Mum, Harry, watch us first. Diagon Alley! What’s that funny clicking noise? Who’s that? Gotcha! Someone’s — tampered — with — this — Bludger — Don’t be thick, It’ll take your head off. Harry! Simply splendid to see you, old boy — “And last,” Nearly wet himself, Sort of freeze your insides, don’t they? Anyway, we’ll see how happy Malfoy looks after our first Quidditch match, Gryffindor versus Slytherin, first game of the season, remember? Spanking good Keeper, Oliver, this year’s our year, Excellent, I need to visit Zonko’s. I’m nearly out of Stink Pellets. He’s only silent because he’s too thick to string two words together, I don’t know why you’re worried, Oliver, Hufflepuff is a pushover. Last time we played them, Harry caught the Snitch in about five minutes, remember? Oliver, calm down! We’re taking Hufflepuff very seriously. Seriously. Harry! How’re you feeling? You fell off, Must’ve been — what — fifty feet? Still in the showers, We think he’s trying to drown himself. C’mon, Harry, you’ve never missed the Snitch before. It’s not over yet, We lost by a hundred points, right? So if Hufflepuff loses to Ravenclaw and we beat Ravenclaw and Slytherin . . . No way, Ravenclaw is too good. But if Slytherin loses against Hufflepuff . . . We’ll come and see you later, Psst — Harry!” We’ve come to give you a bit of festive cheer before we go, Come in here. . . . Early Christmas present for you, Harry, It’s a wrench, giving it to you, but we decided last night, your need’s greater than ours. A bit of old parchment! Explain, George. Well, what would you’ve done? but we’re sure we’re the only ones who know about these. Don’t bother with the one behind the mirror on the fourth floor. We used it until last winter, but it’s caved in — completely blocked. And we don’t reckon anyone’s ever used this one, because the Whomping Willow’s planted right over the entrance. But this one here, this one leads right into the cellar of Honeydukes. We’ve used it loads of times. And as you might’ve noticed, the entrance is right outside this room, through that one-eyed old crone’s hump.” “Noble men, working tirelessly to help a new generation of lawbreakers,” “— or anyone can read it,” Harry! And he’s been off-color for ages, he was wasting away. His finest hour, Let the scar on Goyle’s finger stand as a lasting tribute to his memory. The dementors won’t turn up again, Oliver. Dumbledore’d go ballistic, Show her your acceleration, Harry! With a little help from Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs, Excellent, are we carrying on? Come off it, miss! Maybe Harry can hear us, Dad — maybe he’ll be able to let us out — Harry? Harry, can you hear us? Oh no, Ron, No, this is exactly where we wanted to end up. We’ll get it, the Burrow! Did he eat it? Ton-Tongue Toffee, George and I invented them, and we’ve been looking for someone to test them on all summer. . . . I didn’t give him anything, I just dropped it. . . . It was his fault he went and ate it, I never told him to. We didn’t give it to him because he’s a Muggle! Bulgaria has got Viktor Krum, though, Yep, It was, We sent it. So they’re still in bed? Why can’t we Apparate too? Charlie had to take the test twice, He failed the first time, Apparated five miles south of where he meant to, right on top of some poor old dear doing her shopping, remember? We spent six months developing those! Harry fell off his broom, Dad, I told you . . . it was an accident. . . . Dad’s having fun with the matches, We’ll bet thirty-seven Galleons, fifteen Sickles, three Knuts, Oh and we’ll throw in a fake wand. Anyone can speak Troll, All you have to do is point and grunt. What? What were they talking about? Oh, C’mon, Harry’s wand? Yeah, well, Dad collects plugs, doesn’t he? Birds of a feather . . . Dumbledore’s not what you’d call normal, though, is he? I mean, I know he’s a genius and everything . . . Why? What rules? What rules are they changing? You’re JOKING! I’m going for it! They’re not stopping me entering, The champions’ll get to do all sorts of stuff you’d never be allowed to do normally. And a thousand Galleons prize money! Dunno, but it’s them we’ll have to fool. I reckon a couple of drops of Aging Potion might do it, George. . . . Yeah, Sounds to me like once this judge knows who wants to enter, he’ll choose the best from each school and never mind how old they are. Dumbledore’s trying to stop us giving our names. Yeah, Yeah, but that was years ago, wasn’t it? Anyway, where’s the fun without a bit of risk? Hey, Ron, what if we find out how to get ’round Dumbledore? Fancy entering? Moody! How cool is he? Never had a lesson like it, Fighting the Dark Arts, Wish you would, Not in front of a panel of judges, you haven’t, McGonagall says the champions get awarded points according to how well they’ve done the tasks. Done it, Just taken it. The Aging Potion, dung brains, Ready? C’mon, then — I’ll go first — Hope it’s Angelina, You should’ve told us you’d entered! Shut it! Want a jam tart, Hermione? It’s all right, I haven’t done anything to them. It’s the custard creams you’ve got to watch — Just my little joke, Neville. . . . Yep, ‘Anything we can get you, sir, anything at all! ’ They’re dead helpful . . . get me a roast ox if I said I was peckish. Easy, concealed door behind a painting of a bowl of fruit. Just tickle the pear, and it giggles and — Why? Don’t you go upsetting them and telling them they’ve got to take clothes and salaries! You’ll put them off their cooking! Oh — sorry, Neville! Canary Creams! George and I invented them — seven Sickles each, a bargain! Nice look, Ron . . . go well with your dress robes, that will. Hello, Mr. Bagman, Can we buy you a drink? I wouldn’t mind, Be a talking point, wouldn’t it? We’re supposed to take you down to her office, — that’s blackmail, that is, we could get into a lot of trouble for that — I’m telling you, if you put that in writing, it’s blackmail! Fine — we won’t ask you what you’re doing, if you don’t ask us,  Well, don’t let us hold you up, Don’t be stupid, I was only joking, I’ve told you before, Ron, keep your nose out if you like it the shape it is. Can’t see why you would, but — Exploding Snap, anyone? It doesn’t matter, It wasn’t anything important. Not now, anyway. You remember that bet we had with him at the Quidditch World Cup? About how Ireland would win, but Krum would get the Snitch? Well, the git paid us in leprechaun gold he’d caught from the Irish mascots. So, it vanished, didn’t it? By next morning, it had gone! In the end, he turned pretty nasty, Told us we were too young to gamble, and he wasn’t giving us anything. Right in one, He put a bet on you, mate, Put a big bet on you to win the tournament. Bet against the goblins. You don’t want to bottle up your anger like that, Harry, let it all out, There might be a couple of people fifty miles away who didn’t hear you. With distinction, Time is Galleons, Anyway, Harry, you’re interfering with reception. Extendable Ears, We’re trying to hear what’s going on downstairs. It’s worth the risk, that’s a major meeting they’re having, Git, He applied for a desk job so he could come home and work for the Order, — and Bill’s been giving her a lot of private lessons, Because every time Percy’s name’s mentioned, Dad breaks whatever he’s holding and Mum starts crying, Percy and Dad had a row, Only Dad wasn’t, Dumbledore’s name’s mud with the Ministry these days, see, They all think he’s just making trouble saying You-Know-Who’s back. “Uh-oh.” Dammit, Sirius? Sorry Sirius, mate — didn’t mean to — How come Harry gets his questions answered? ‘You’re too young, you’re not in the Order,’ Harry’s not even of age! “You can’t boss us —” Asleep, yeah, right, If Ginny’s not lying awake waiting for Hermione to tell her everything they said downstairs, then I’m a flobberworm . . . Sleep tight, Let slip, more like, We didn’t hear about that on the old Extendables, did we? Could be anything, If it is, Dumbledore’s probably keeping it, Not necessarily, Right-o, Us, We take it in turns. George did the Fainting Fancies — we both tried the Nosebleed Nougat — Well, we haven’t had a chance to get premises yet, so we’re running it as a mail-order service at the moment. We put advertisements in the Daily Prophet last week. Yeah, you’re right! Blimey, Mum won’t like that . . . Mundungus is talking to Sirius and Kingsley, Can’t hear properly . . . d’you reckon we can risk the Extendable Ears? I love hearing Mum shouting at someone else, It makes such a nice change. Hello, Kreacher, Don’t kid yourself, Hermione, he knows exactly what he’s saying, Don’t we all, Kreacher? We were just wondering who assigned the Slinkhard book, And about time too, Well, we overheard Mum and Dad talking on the Extendable Ears a few weeks back, and from what they were saying, Dumbledore was having real trouble finding anyone to do the job this year. What’s up? What’s the matter? Prefect? Prefect? There’s been a mistake, No one in their right mind would make Ron a prefect . . . We thought you were a cert! Winning the Triwizard and everything! Yeah, Yeah, you’ve caused too much trouble, mate. Well, at least one of you’s got their priorities right. His badge, His lovely shiny new prefect’s badge. We’ve already bought him some, Ron? Or what? Going to put us in detention? We’re going to have to watch our step, George, with these two on our case . . . No one in their right mind would make Ron a prefect . . . It’s okay, we can trust Harry, he’s our financial backer. Ten Galleons the lot, then, Dung? Dung likes his little joke, What’s up? Mum’s busy cooing over Prefect Ron, we’re okay. Cheers, Harry! We’d better get these upstairs . . . Well, can’t stand around chatting all day, we’ve got business to discuss with Lee. See you later, Do mine ears deceive me? Hogwarts prefects surely don’t wish to skive off lessons? Fair point, little bro, You can have a bit of Nosebleed Nougat cheap if you like. You’ll be singing a different tune soon enough, Hermione, You’re starting your fifth year, you’ll be begging us for a Snackbox before long. So you’ve got your exams coming up, haven’t you? They’ll be keeping your noses so hard to that grindstone they’ll be rubbed raw, Kenneth Towler came out in boils, d’you remember? Oh yeah, I’d forgotten. . . . Hard to keep track sometimes, isn’t it? Yep, But we feel our futures lie outside the world of academic achievement. We’re not going to waste our last year here, though, We’re going to use it to do a bit of market research, find out exactly what the average Hogwarts student requires from his joke shop, carefully evaluate the results of our research, and then produce the products to fit the demand. Ask us no questions and we’ll tell you no lies, Hermione. C’mon, George, if we get there early we might be able to sell a few Extendable Ears before Herbology. We’re paying them! Rubbish, Excellent, ’Course it is, they’re alive, aren’t they? We’re not going to make them ill, we’ve already tested them all on ourselves, this is just to see if everyone reacts the same — Put us in detention? She’s there, Ready to show us all up, Ickle Prefect? Here, take this, It’ll clear it up in no time. Yeah, well, I hope he hasn’t peaked too soon, We’ll take her, Hi, Could we have . . . twenty-five butterbeers, please? Cheers, Cough up, everyone, I haven’t got enough gold for all of these . . . Mum told Ron not to spread it around, She said you got enough attention as it was. That’s not what he said, Or any part of your body, really, we’re not fussy where we stick this, Well, time’s ticking on, George, Lee, and I have got items of a sensitive nature to purchase, we’ll be seeing you all later. What are we going to do? The prefects as well? Well, yeah, I think a few of mine have ruptured, It’s bizarre, We once hid from Filch in here, remember, George? But it was just a broom cupboard then . . . Or the Ministry of Magic Are Morons Group? It’s not my fault I didn’t, I would’ve pounded the little scumbag to a pulp if you three hadn’t been holding me back. We’re all really sorry Harry didn’t tell you, then, Ask Harry, Is Mum here? ’Course we can go to St. Mungo’s if we want, he’s our dad! We don’t care about the dumb Order! Easy for you to say, stuck here! I don’t see you risking your neck! Ron and Ginny not here? Good.   We were watching their practice.They’re going to be slaughtered. They’re complete rubbish without us. Well, he can do it if he doesn’t think anyone’s watching him, So all we have to do is ask the crowd to turn their backs and talk among themselves every time the Quaffle goes up his end on Saturday. You know, Quidditch was about the only thing in this place worth staying for. Told you already, we’re not fussed about N.E.W.T.s,   The Snackboxes are ready to roll, we found out how to get rid of those boils, just a couple of drops of murtlap essence sorts them, Lee put us onto it . . . Kill him, more like, I haven’t got the heart to take the mickey out of him, even, Mind you . . . when he missed the fourteenth . . . Well, I’ll save it for parties, eh? This one’s in two minds, Says you don’t come across as a mad person, but he really doesn’t want to believe You-Know-Who’s back so he doesn’t know what to think now. . . . Blimey, what a waste of parchment . . . Is that a crime now?  Getting mail? Noticed, have you? He never managed to get all the words out, due to the fact that we forced him headfirst into that Vanishing Cabinet on the first floor. Not until Montague reappears, and that could take weeks, I dunno where we sent him, Anyway . . . we’ve decided we don’t care about getting into trouble anymore. But we’ve always stopped short of causing real mayhem, — what with Dumbledore gone — — is exactly what our dear new Head deserves, You don’t get it, Hermione, do you? We don’t care about staying anymore. We’d walk out right now if we weren’t determined to do our bit for Dumbledore first. So anyway, phase one is about to begin. I’d get in the Great Hall for lunch if I were you, that way the teachers will see you can’t have had anything to do with it. Hey, Ginny’s had a word with us about you, She says you need to talk to Sirius? What was the point, we asked ourselves, of disrupting leisure time? No point at all, we answered ourselves. But it’s business as usual from tomorrow, And if we’re going to be causing a bit of uproar, why not do it so that Harry can have his chat with Sirius? Spoken like a true friend and Weasley, Right, then. You’ll see, little bro, At least, you will if you trot along to Gregory the Smarmy’s corridor round about five o’clock tomorrow. Finest dragon skin, little bro, Business is booming and we thought we’d treat ourselves. / For freaks like Dad, you know, who love Muggle stuff. It’s not a big earner, but we do fairly steady business, they’re great novelties. . . . Oh, here’s George. . . . / We’ve just developed this more serious line, Funny how it happened . . . And our Decoy Detonators are just walking off the shelves, look, You just drop one surreptitiously and it’ll run off and make a nice loud noise out of sight, giving you a diversion if you need one. I beg your pardon? Aaah, George, look at this. They’re using knives and everything. Bless them. I’m sure you’ll dazzle us all with hitherto unsuspected magical skills, What a snappy retort, I really don’t know how you think of them. No, what we wanted to know was . . . how did it happen? Did she have an accident or something? Well, how did she sustain such extensive brain damage? Careful, now! — that’ll make Ginny’s Christmas — Percy definitely not showing his ugly face, then? Or he’s the world’s biggest prat, One of the two. Well, let’s get going, then, George. No, I don’t think we can do that, It’s very character-building stuff, learning to peel sprouts without magic, makes you appreciate how difficult it is for Muggles and Squibs — So, all in all, not one of Ron’s better birthdays? Yeah, when we pictured the scene, he was conscious, We were thinking of buying Zonko’s, How exactly did it happen, Harry? Do Mum and Dad know? So the poison was in the drink? Would he have been able to slip something into Ron’s glass without you seeing? No idea, You don’t think he could have mixed up the glasses by mistake? Meaning to get you? No idea, but there must be loads of people who’d like to poison Harry, mustn’t there? ‘The Chosen One’ and all that? Anything’s possible, Wood might’ve done the Slytherins if he could’ve got away with it, How d’you work that out? Well, none of us really fancy it, Harry, Imagine if something went wrong and we were stuck as specky, scrawny gits forever. Yeah, thirteen of us against one bloke who’s not allowed to use magic; we’ve got no chance, I dunno, though, I think I’m still better-looking, I’m George, Can’t you even tell us apart when we’re Harry? I’m only yanking your wand, I’m Fred really — What’s wrong with him? Is his mind affected? Pathetic, Pathetic! With the whole wide world of ear-related humor before you, you go for holey? What happened? What happened? Who’s — ? Well said, Harry, When I get married, I won’t be bothering with any of this nonsense. You can all wear what you like, and I’ll put a full Body-Bind Curse on Mum until it’s all over. Not so fast, Your Holeyness, Time to sit down, or we’re going to get run over by the bride. ‘Rodent’? I’m not being ‘Rodent,’ no way, I told you I wanted to be ‘Rapier’! Yes, River, I can, As our listeners will know, unless they’ve taken refuge at the bottom of a garden pond or somewhere similar, You-Know-Who’s strategy of remaining in the shadows is creating a nice little climate of panic. Mind you, if all the alleged sightings of him are genuine, we must have a good nineteen You-Know-Whos running around the place. Agreed, So, people, let’s try and calm down a bit. Things are bad enough without inventing stuff as well. For instance, this new idea that You-Know-Who can kill with a single glance from his eyes. That’s a basilisk, listeners. One simple test: Check whether the thing that’s glaring at you has got legs. If it has, it’s safe to look into its eyes, although if it really is You-Know-Who, that’s still likely to be the last thing you ever do. Well, who wouldn’t want a nice little holiday after all the hard work he’s been putting in? Point is, people, don’t get lulled into a false sense of security, thinking he’s out of the country. I never thought I’d hear myself say it, but safety first! Aberforth’s getting a bit annoyed, He wants a kip, and his bar’s turned into a railway station. Just going to make it up as we go along, are we? My favorite kind, We sent messages to the rest of Dumbledore’s Army, You couldn’t expect everyone to miss the fun, Harry and the D.A. let the Order of the Phoenix know, and it all kind of snowballed. A teenagers’ gang! A teenagers’ gang that’s about to take him on, which no one else has dared to do! Ministry-loving, family-disowning, power-hungry moron, Well, you can’t say fairer than that, Sounds like a job for us, Nice night for it!",

He said he’d been looking for someone to practice that on. I don’t want more trouble, There’s no need to tell me I’m not brave enough to be in Gryffindor, Malfoy’s already done that, Thanks, Harry . . . I think I’ll go to bed. . . .

I’m worth twelve of you, Malfoy, “What are you doing?” “You’re going out again,”  “Go on then, try and hit me!” Sorry — d’you know what’s going on? — Ouch — sorry — Harry? Is that you? What’s happening? Ouch! It was horrible, Did you feel how cold it got when it came in? I think so, Help me! Professor Snape. Er — yes, But — I don’t want the boggart to turn into her either. Well, A big red one, Yes, . . Riddikulus! Riddikulus! . . Riddikulus! Riddikulus! Ha! I wrote them down! But I must’ve dropped them somewhere! I’ve lost the passwords! I made him tell me what passwords he was going to use this week, because he keeps changing them, and now I don’t know what I’ve done with them!

She’s always going on about how I should be upholding the family honor. I’ll just have to — oops. . . . There’s one — the Cruciatus Curse, Oh hello, Interesting lesson, wasn’t it? Oh yes, I’m fine, Very interesting dinner — I mean lesson — what’s for eating? Oh yes, I’m fine, I’m fine, thanks. Just reading this book Professor Moody lent me. . . . Apparently, Professor Sprout told Professor Moody I’m really good at Herbology, He thought I’d like this. It was someone being tortured! You’re going to have to fight the Cruciatus Curse! Hi, Harry, Hi, Ginny. . . . Everywhere’s full. . . . I can’t find a seat . . . I’m nobody, Guess what I got for my birthday? No, I could do with one, though, I lost the old one ages ago. . . . No, look at this . . . Mimbulus mimbletonia, It’s really, really rare, I don’t know if there’s one in the greenhouse at Hogwarts, even. I can’t wait to show it to Professor Sprout. My great-uncle Algie got it for me in Assyria. I’m going to see if I can breed from it. Loads of stuff! It’s got an amazing defensive mechanism — hold Trevor for me . S-sorry, I haven’t tried that before. . . . Didn’t realize it would be quite so . . . Don’t worry, though, Stinksap’s not poisonous, Sorry, What? Guess what it is?

Well, I’b going do find dem wid you, We’ll dake her wid us, My gran’s going do kill be, dat was by dad’s old wand . . . STUPEFY! STUBEFY! He’s dot alone! He’s still god be! STUPEFY! STUBEFY! I DOE YOU HAB! Harry! DON’D GIB ID DO DEM, HARRY! Yes, I dink he’s all right — he was still fighding the brain when I left — Harry, I’b so sorry, Harry, I didn’d bean do — Dubbledore! DUBBLEDORE! Dubbledore! DUBBLEDORE! Yes, everything’s settled right back down again. Hi, Harry! They’re even staring at us! Because we’re with you! Yes, I thought Gran would be angry about all the publicity, but she was really pleased. Says I’m starting to live up to my dad at long last. She bought me a new wand, look! Cherry and unicorn hair, We think it was one of the last Ollivander ever sold, he vanished next day — oi, come back here, Trevor! I learned loads with you! We didn’t face him, though, ‘That Harry Potter’s got more backbone than the whole Ministry of Magic put together! ’ She’d give anything to have you as a grandson. . . . Harry? You look funny, Who’s Professor Slughorn? But what does he want me for? I’m glad that’s over, Strange man, isn’t he? But what’re you — ? my grandmother wants My grandmother thinks Charms is a soft option, M’all right, Harry . . . Snape ’n’ Malfoy . . . ran past . . . I knew you’d come! Kept telling Seamus it was a matter of time! What? This? This is nothing. Seamus is worse. You’ll see. Shall we get going then? Oh, Ab, there might be a couple more people on the way. I know, that’s why they’ll be Apparating directly into the bar, Just send them down the passage when they get here, will you? Thanks a lot. They sealed off all of those before the start of the year, There’s no chance of getting through any of them now, not with curses over the entrances and Death Eaters and dementors waiting at the exits. Never mind that stuff . . . Is it true? Did you break into Gringotts? Did you escape on a dragon? It’s everywhere, everyone’s talking about it, Terry Boot got beaten up by Carrow for yelling about it in the Great Hall at dinner! What did you do with the dragon? Don’t exaggerate, Ron — What? People have been saying you’ve just been on the run, Harry, but I don’t think so. I think you’ve been up to something. It’s been . . . well, it’s not really like Hogwarts anymore, Do you know about the Carrows? They do more than teach, They’re in charge of all discipline. They like punishment, the Carrows. Nah, they make her look tame. The other teachers are all supposed to refer us to the Carrows if we do anything wrong. They don’t, though, if they can avoid it. You can tell they all hate them as much as we do. Amycus, the bloke, he teaches what used to be Defense Against the Dark Arts, except now it’s just the Dark Arts. We’re supposed to practice the Cruciatus Curse on people who’ve earned detentions — Yeah, That’s how I got this one, I refused to do it. Some people are into it, though; Crabbe and Goyle love it. First time they’ve ever been top in anything, I expect. Alecto, Amycus’s sister, teaches Muggle Studies, which is compulsory for everyone. We’ve all got to listen to her explain how Muggles are like animals, stupid and dirty, and how they drove wizards into hiding by being vicious toward them, and how the natural order is being reestablished. I got this one, for asking her how much Muggle blood she and her brother have got. You didn’t hear her, You wouldn’t have stood it either. The thing is, it helps when people stand up to them, it gives everyone hope. I used to notice that when you did it, Harry. Doesn’t matter. They don’t want to spill too much pure blood, so they’ll torture us a bit if we’re mouthy but they won’t actually kill us. The only people in real danger are the ones whose friends and relatives on the outside are giving trouble. They get taken hostage. Old Xeno Lovegood was getting a bit too outspoken in The Quibbler, so they dragged Luna off the train on the way back for Christmas. Yeah, These have been great, The Carrows never rumbled how we were communicating, it drove them mad. We used to sneak out at night and put graffiti on the walls:Dumbledore’s Army, Still Recruiting, stuff like that.   Snape hated it. Well, it got more difficult as time went on, We lost Luna at Christmas, and Ginny never came back after Easter, and the three of us were sort of the leaders. The Carrows seemed to know I was behind a lot of it, so they started coming down on me hard, and then Michael Corner went and got caught releasing a first-year they’d chained up, and they tortured him pretty badly. That scared people off. Yeah, But we were still fighting, doing underground stuff, right up until a couple of weeks ago. That’s when they decided there was only one way to stop me, I suppose, and they went for Gran. Yeah, Yeah, well, you can see their thinking. It had worked really well, kidnapping kids to force their relatives to behave, I s’pose it was only a matter of time before they did it the other way around. Thing was, they bit off a bit more than they could chew with Gran. Little old witch living alone, they probably thought they didn’t need to send anyone particularly powerful. Anyway, Dawlish is still in St. Mungo’s and Gran’s on the run. She sent me a letter, telling me she was proud of me, that I’m my parents’ son, and to keep it up. Yeah, Yeah, Only thing was, once they realized they had no hold over me, they decided Hogwarts could do without me after all. I don’t know whether they were planning to kill me or send me to Azkaban; either way, I knew it was time to disappear. ’Course, You’ll see. We’re here. “Look who it is! Didn’t I tell you?” Okay, okay, calm down! Room of Requirement, of course! Surpassed itself, hasn’t it? The Carrows were chasing me, and I knew I had just one chance for a hideout: I managed to get through the door and this is what I found! Well, it wasn’t exactly like this when I arrived, it was a load smaller, there was only one hammock and just Gryffindor hangings. But it’s expanded as more and more of the D. A. have arrived. It’s quite straightforward, really, I’d been in here about a day and a half, and getting really hungry, and wishing I could get something to eat, and that’s when the passage to the Hog’s Head opened up. I went through it and met Aberforth. He’s been providing us with food, because for some reason, that’s the one thing the room doesn’t really do. They did! And the dragon’s true too! Are you all right, Harry? Want to sit down? I expect you’re tired, aren’t — ? What d’you mean, ‘get out of here’? What is it? Why can’t you tell us? It’s something to do with fighting You-Know-Who, right? Then we’ll help you. What? We’re his army, Dumbledore’s Army. We were all in it together, we’ve been keeping it going while you three have been off on your own — I never said it had, but I don’t see why you can’t trust us. Everyone in this room’s been fighting and they’ve been driven in here because the Carrows were hunting them down. Everyone in here’s proven they’re loyal to Dumbledore — loyal to you. I sent for her, I promised her and Ginny that if you turned up I’d let them know. We all thought that if you came back, it would mean revolution. That we were going to overthrow Snape and the Carrows. Then let us help! We want to be a part of it! Over here. It comes out somewhere different every day, so they’ve never been able to find it, Only trouble is, we never know exactly where we’re going to end up when we go out. Be careful, Harry, they’re always patrolling the corridors at night. Mandrakes! Going to lob them over the walls — they won’t like this! Blimey, Harry, you nearly gave me heart failure! Where are you going, alone? Harry! Harry, you’re not thinking of handing yourself over? I’ve heard, yeah. . . . What about it? Kill the snake? All right, Harry. You’re okay, are you? We’re all going to keep fighting, Harry. You know that?",

C’mere and help!” “He is,” “Or twice —” “A minute —” “All summer —” “How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?” Blown up a toilet? We’ve never blown up a toilet. Great idea though, thanks, Mum.” Don’t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us. We’ll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat. Only joking, Mum. Harry, did we introduce ourselves? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then. Well done, Wood told us. We’re on the team too — Beaters. Bet it’s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in our first week. See you. “Why aren’t you wearing yours, Ron?” Come on, get it on, they’re lovely and warm.” No problem, So — we’ll get your trunk — you grab anything you need from your room and hand it out to Ron, “Okay, let’s go,” I’ve heard Dad talking about him, He was a big supporter of You-Know-Who. Percy’s been acting very oddly this summer, And he has been sending a lot of letters and spending a load of time shut up in his room. . . . I mean, there’s only so many times you can polish a prefect badge. . . . You’re driving too far west, Fred, That’s the main road, We’ll be there in ten minutes. . . . Just as well, it’s getting light. . . . Mum, we know how to de-gnome a garden — And the Slytherins don’t need a spy, Oliver, Because they’re here in person, Close one, Harry! We need time out, We were twenty feet above her, stopping the other Bludger from murdering Harry, Oliver, Someone’s fixed it — it won’t leave Harry alone. It hasn’t gone for anyone else all game. The Slytherins must have done something to it. This is all your fault, Marvelous, Absolutely spiffing. What do we want to be prefects for? It’d take all the fun out of life. New third-year course schedules, What’s up with you, Harry? That little git, He wasn’t so cocky last night when the dementors were down at our end of the train. Came running into our compartment, didn’t he, Fred? I wasn’t too happy myself, They’re horrible things, those dementors. . . . Forget it, Harry, Dad had to go out to Azkaban one time, remember, Fred? And he said it was the worst place he’d ever been, he came back all weak and shaking. . . . They suck the happiness out of a place, dementors. Most of the prisoners go mad in there. We think you’re very good too, Oliver, Diggory got the Snitch, Just after you fell. He didn’t realize what had happened. When he looked back and saw you on the ground, he tried to call it off. Wanted a rematch. But they won fair and square . . . even Wood admits it. There had to be one time you didn’t get it, Hufflepuff’ll have to lose by at least two hundred points, But if they beat Ravenclaw . . . It all depends on the points — a margin of a hundred either way — This, Harry, is the secret of our success, Anyway, we know it by heart, We bequeath it to you. We don’t really need it anymore. Well . . . when we were in our first year, Harry — young, carefree, and innocent — — well, more innocent than we are now — we got into a spot of bother with Filch. We let off a Dungbomb in the corridor and it upset him for some reason — So he hauled us off to his office and started threatening us with the usual — — detention — — disembowelment — It’s not as bad as it sounds, you know, We don’t reckon Filch ever found out how to work it. He probably suspected what it was, though, or he wouldn’t have confiscated it. I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.” “Just tap it again and say, ‘Mischief managed!’ And it’ll go blank.” “See you in Honeydukes,” All he did was eat and sleep, Ron, you said it yourself, Yeah, we’re having the time of our lives here, the Burrow! How big did his tongue get? Harry? Isn’t he, Harry? Yeah, we’ll come too, Where’re Bill and Charlie and Per-Per-Percy? Percy only passed two weeks ago, He’s been Apparating downstairs every morning since, just to prove he can. What? Nothing! You’ve been ages, Cheers, Mad-Eye Moody? Why? They can’t do that! We’re seventeen in April, why can’t we have a shot? Beyond cool, Knows what it’s like to be out there doing it, He’s seen it all, No — that sounds like we’re accusing him. Got to be careful . . . It’s a bummer, all right, But if he won’t talk to us in person, we’ll have to send him the letter after all. Or we’ll stuff it into his hand. He can’t avoid us forever. Having a nosy git like you for a brother, She just told me to shut up and get on with Transfiguring my raccoon. Listen, have you ever been down in the kitchens, Hermione? Well, we have, loads of times, to nick food. And we’ve met them, and they’re happy. They think they’ve got the best job in the world — One drop each, We only need to be a few months older. How did you do it without getting a beard? Brilliant! Don’t be a prat, Neville, that’s illegal, They wouldn’t use the Cruciatus Curse on the champions. I thought it sounded a bit like Percy singing . . . maybe you’ve got to attack him while he’s in the shower, Harry. Going to try and lead the house-elves out on strike now, are you? Going to give up all the leaflet stuff and try and stir them up into rebellion? — we’ve tried being polite; it’s time to play dirty, like him. He wouldn’t like the Ministry of Magic knowing what he did — Yeah, and you won’t be complaining if we get a nice fat payoff, will you? Told you, I was joking, You’re starting to sound a bit like our dear older brother, you are, Ron. Carry on like this and you’ll be made a prefect. Well, stop telling people what to do then. See you later. Oh, That. We’ve given up, Nah, Nothing like that.  Stupid git. He wouldn’t have the brains. Yeah, that’s what we thought, at first. We thought if we just wrote to him, and told him he’d made a mistake, he’d cough up. But nothing doing. Ignored our letter. We kept trying to talk to him about it at Hogwarts, but he was always making some excuse to get away from us. So we asked for our money back, Tell me about it, ’Course, we found out what was going on in the end. Turns out he’s in big trouble with the goblins. Borrowed loads of gold off them. A gang of them cornered him in the woods after the World Cup and took all the gold he had, and it still wasn’t enough to cover all his debts. They followed him all the way to Hogwarts to keep an eye on him. He’s lost everything gambling. Hasn’t got two Galleons to rub together. And you know how the idiot tried to pay the goblins back? Nope, The goblins play as dirty as him. They say you drew with Diggory, and Bagman was betting you’d win outright. So Bagman had to run for it. He did run for it right after the third task. Hello, Harry, We thought we heard your dulcet tones. How d’you know? Yeah, Giving a report. Top secret. Charlie’s in the Order too, I think we’re well shut of him, Yeah, because Percy got into a load of trouble about Crouch, there was an inquiry and everything. They said Percy ought to have realized Crouch was off his rocker and informed a superior. But you know Percy, Crouch left him in charge, he wasn’t going to complain . . . Well, apparently Fudge has been storming round the Ministry checking that nobody’s having any contact with Dumbledore, Dad says Fudge has made it clear that anyone who’s in league with Dumbledore can clear out their desks, Dumbledore. He went completely berserk. He said — well, he said loads of terrible stuff. Hang on! We’ve been trying to get stuff out of you for a month and you haven’t told us a single stinking thing! Keep your voice down, Ron, or Mum’ll be back up here. Yeah, well, it’s harder in the dark — So, got there yet? Maybe it’s something that can kill loads of people at once, So who d’you think’s got it now? Bet it is! That’s where he hid the Sorcerer’s Stone! Yeah, size is no guarantee of power, Look at Ginny. You’ve never been on the receiving end of one of her Bat-Bogey Hexes, have you? Mum, We want to experiment with doxy venom for our Skiving Snackboxes, Range of sweets to make you ill, Not seriously ill, mind, just ill enough to get you out of a class when you feel like it. Fred and I have been developing them this summer. They’re double-ended, color-coded chews. If you eat the orange half of the Puking Pastilles, you throw up. Moment you’ve been rushed out of the lesson for the hospital wing, you swallow the purple half — ‘— which restores you to full fitness, enabling you to pursue the leisure activity of your own choice during an hour that would otherwise have been devoted to unprofitable boredom. ’ That’s what we’re putting in the adverts, anyway, But they still need a bit of work. At the moment our testers are having a bit of trouble stopping puking long enough to swallow the purple end. Mum thought we’d been dueling, All thanks to you, mate, But don’t worry . . . Mum hasn’t got a clue. She won’t read the Daily Prophet anymore, ’cause of it telling lies about you and Dumbledore. Might be worth it, The idiots are letting her get into her stride, You’ve got to head her off early, otherwise she builds up a head of steam and goes on for hours. And she’s been dying to have a go at Mundungus ever since he sneaked off when he was supposed to be following you, Harry — and there goes Sirius’s mum again — Sorry? Didn’t catch that last bit. What do you want anyway? Because it means Dumbledore’s found a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Not surprising, is it, when you look at what’s happened to the last four? No way, We thought Dumbledore was bound to pick you! I suppose all the mad stuff must’ve counted against him, Oh, Mum’s going to be revolting, Unexpected, Get him red and gold to match his badge, What? We could curtsy, if you like, I’d love to see him try, Yeah, Look what Dung’s gotten us, Venomous Tentacula seeds, Yeah, Says who? Fifth year’s O. W.L. year, Half our year had minor breakdowns coming up to O. W.L.s, Tears and tantrums . . . Patricia Stimpson kept coming over faint . . . That’s ’cause you put Bulbadox Powder in his pajamas, Anyway, it’s a nightmare of a year, the fifth, If you care about exam results anyway. Fred and I managed to keep our spirits up somehow. We seriously debated whether we were going to bother coming back for our seventh year, — now that we’ve got our O. W.L.s, I mean, do we really need N. E.W.T.s? But we didn’t think Mum could take us leaving school early, not on top of Percy turning out to be the world’s biggest prat. Yeah, you’re right, this dosage looks strong enough, doesn’t it? Yeah, look, they’re coming round now, Feel all right? Make us write lines? You wouldn’t, Let her sleep, All right, Ron? Ron’s making a right pig’s ear of things, isn’t he? Would you like us to clean out your ears for you? Knew you’d say that, We could try the Fever Fudge, — but you get these massive pus-filled boils too, and we haven’t worked out how to get rid of them yet. Mine haven’t, They’re throbbing like mad . . . feel bigger if anything . . . Sorry, Harry, Couldn’t resist . . . He insulted my parents, And Harry’s mother. Yeah, I want to hear this for myself, What does that matter? It’s our dad dying we’re talking about! Dad is still alive. I am setting out for St. Mungo’s now. Stay where you are. I will send news as soon as I can. Mum. Still alive . . . But that makes it sound . . . Headless Hats! Two Galleons each — watch Fred, now! And off again! Come on, Ginny’s not bad, Actually, I dunno how she got so good, seeing how we never let her play with us . . . Oh, Well — that’d explain it. I dunno if I even want to watch this match. If Zacharias Smith beats us I might have to kill myself. Yeah, Montague tried to do us during break, ’Course we have, Never been expelled, have we? We’ve always known where to draw the line, We might have put a toe across it occasionally, Well, now — — we reckon a bit of mayhem — You’ll see, Run along, now. Cheers, Oh, I hope she tries Vanishing them next. . . . They multiply by ten every time you try . . . Well, It’s a simple matter of causing a diversion. Now, you might have noticed that we have been rather quiet on the mayhem front during the Easter holidays? Easy, You wouldn’t believe how many people, even people who work at the Ministry, can’t do a decent Shield Charm, ’Course, they didn’t have you teaching them, Harry. / And we’re still getting massive orders! So we’ve expanded into a range of Shield Cloaks, Shield Gloves . . . . . . I mean, they wouldn’t help much against the Unforgivable Curses, but for minor to moderate hexes or jinxes . . . And then we thought we’d get into the whole area of Defense Against the Dark Arts, because it’s such a money spinner, This is cool. Look, Instant Darkness Powder, we’re importing it from Peru. Handy if you want to make a quick escape. Here, But meanwhile, we can enjoy watching you demonstrate the correct use of a — whoops-a-daisy! And speaking of hitherto unsuspected skills, Ronald, No problem, — and if you want people to help you, Ron, I wouldn’t chuck knives at them. Just a little hint. We’re off to the village, there’s a very pretty girl working in the paper shop who thinks my card tricks are something marvelous . . . almost like real magic. . . . Well, we find we appreciate you more and more, Mum, now we’re washing our own socks, Parsnips, Remus? This isn’t how we imagined handing over our present, There we were in Hogsmeade, waiting to surprise him — Blimey, it was lucky you thought of a bezoar, He could be under the Imperius Curse, Who’d want to kill Slughorn? Hagrid makes six, I can’t see anyone trying to bump off a Quidditch team, Ah, Obviously there’s no chance at all of us getting a bit of your hair unless you cooperate. Saintlike, Saintlike, You see . . . I’m holy. Holey, Fred, geddit? Ah well, You’ll be able to tell us apart now, anyway, Mum. Hi, Harry — you are Harry, right? Well, at least we got you back okay, Why aren’t Ron and Bill huddled round my sickbed? Yeah, ’ear, ’ear, Yeah, Mad-Eye wouldn’t want — She wasn’t too bad this morning, considering, Cried a bit about Percy not being here, but who wants him? Oh blimey, brace yourselves — here they come, look. Excellent, I think I see a few veela cousins, They’ll need help understanding our English customs, I’ll look after them. . . . What? What first, Harry? What’s going on? What made you see sense, Perce? Well, we do look to our prefects to take a lead at times such as these, Now let’s get upstairs and fight, or all the good Death Eaters’ll be taken.",

Oh — well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George’s jokes, And have you really got — you know . . . So that’s where You-Know-Who — ? Nothing? Wow, Yes, I think Mum’s got a second cousin who’s an accountant, but we never talk about him. Five, I’m the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I’ve got a lot to live up to. Now Percy’s a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they’re really funny. You never get anything new, either, with five brothers. I’ve got Bill’s old robes, Charlie’s old wand, and Percy’s old rat. His name’s Scabbers and he’s useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn’t aff — I mean, I got Scabbers instead. I’d have thought you, of all people — You won’t be. There’s loads of people who come from Muggle families and they learn quick enough. Hungry, are you? She always forgets I don’t like corned beef. Five, She hasn’t got much time, you know, with five of us. Oh, of course, you wouldn’t know — Chocolate Frogs have cards inside them, you know, to collect — famous witches and wizards. I’ve got about five hundred, but I haven’t got Agrippa or Ptolemy. Don’t tell me you’d never heard of Dumbledore! Help yourself,” You want to be careful with those, George reckons he had a booger-flavored one once. Bleaaargh — see? Sprouts. “He might have died and you wouldn’t know the difference,” “I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but the spell didn’t work.  I’ll show you, look . . .” “Unicorn hair’s nearly poking out. Anyway —” “We’ve already told him we haven’t seen it,” Er — okay, “I’m Ron Weasley,” “Whatever House I’m in, I hope she’s not in it,” “Yeah,” “Charlie’s in Romania studying dragons, and Bill’s in Africa doing something for Gringotts,” “Did you hear about Gringotts? It’s been all over the Daily Prophet, but I don’t suppose you get that with the Muggles — someone tried to rob a high security vault.” Nothing, that’s why it’s such big news. They haven’t been caught. My dad says it must’ve been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they don’t think they took anything, that’s what’s odd. ’Course, everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case You-Know-Who’s behind it.” “What’s your Quidditch team?” “Say that again,” I think he’s been knocked out, No — I don’t believe it — he’s gone back to sleep. I’ve heard of his family,   They were some of the first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said they’d been bewitched. My dad doesn’t believe it. He says Malfoy’s father didn’t need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.  Can we help you with something? Scabbers has been fighting, not us, Would you mind leaving while we change? Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking. So we’ve just got to try on the hat! I’ll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll. What about you, Neville? Hagrid You don’t know that you’ll make a fool of yourself, Anyway, I know Malfoy’s always going on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet that’s all talk. You’re joking. Of course he has, I’m his second, who’s yours? Well, a second’s there to take over if you die Throw it away and punch him on the nose, “Can’t a person eat in peace in this place?” Bet you could, See you. Half-past eleven, we’d better go. “I’m coming with you,” “You’ve got some nerve — “Mrs. Norris?” “Keep your voice down, Neville. The password’s ‘Pig snout’ but it won’t help you now, the Fat Lady’s gone off somewhere.” “If either of you get us caught, I’ll never rest until I’ve learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.” “He’s late, maybe he’s chickened out,” “Get out of the way,” No, we don’t mind, You’d think we dragged her along, wouldn’t you? It’s either really valuable or really dangerous, It’s not any old broomstick, it’s a Nimbus Two Thousand. What did you say you’ve got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty? Comets look flashy, but they’re not in the same league as the Nimbus. Wow “Wingardium Leviosa!” “Wingardium Leviosa!” “You do it, then, if you’re so clever,” “I’ve just thought — Hermione.” “She doesn’t know about the troll.” “Percy!” How could I know? “Can you smell something?” Good idea, Oh, no, Oy, pea-brain! “Wingardium Leviosa!” “Wingardium Leviosa!” We should have gotten more than ten points, Right, Mind you, we did save her. Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something, I’m with Harry. I wouldn’t put anything past Snape. But what’s he after? What’s that dog guarding? Hagrid Hagrid Hagrid Hagrid Hagrid Hagrid Nope, Harry hasn’t had much to do yet. What are you doing? What should we do? Come on, Hermione, Neville, you can look! It was Snape, Hermione and I saw him. He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn’t take his eyes off you. Hi, Hagrid, want any help? WEASLEY! I’ll get him, one of these days, I’ll get him — Just have to find out for ourselves, then, Merry Christmas, What did you expect, turnips? “It is! Look down!” “I hate maroon,” You could have woken me up, I’d like to see your mum and dad, You can see them any old time, Just come round my house this summer. Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people. Shame about not finding Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why aren’t you eating anything? “I can’t see anything.” “I can only see you.” “Look at me!” “No — I’m alone — but I’m different — I look older — and I’m Head Boy!” “I am — I’m wearing the badge like Bill used to — and I’m holding the House Cup and the Quidditch Cup — I’m Quidditch captain, too!” “Do you think this mirror shows the future?” “You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time.” “Don’t push me —” This isn’t safe — she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us. Come on. Want to play chess, Why don’t we go down and visit Hagrid? I know what you’re thinking about, Harry, that mirror. Don’t go back tonight. What if they walk into you? What if you knock something over? I’m serious, Harry, don’t go. What’s the matter with you? You look terrible. Say you’re ill, Really break your leg, You’ve got to stand up to him, Neville! He’s used to walking all over people, but that’s no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier. Light? “Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn’t see you there.” You tell him, Neville. I’m warning you, Malfoy — one more word — What? Where? We’ve won! It’ll be gone by next Tuesday, “Hagrid! What are you doing in the library?” But it’s against our laws, You should see the burns Charlie’s got off wild ones in Romania. Of course there are, Common Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks. The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up, I can tell you. Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who’ve spotted them, to make them forget. Wonder what it’s like to have a peaceful life, Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching? I’m not going to be able to hold a quill for a week. I tell you, that dragon’s the most horrible animal I’ve ever met, but the way Hagrid goes on about it, you’d think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off for frightening it. And when I left, he was singing it a lullaby. It’s not just my hand, although that feels like it’s about to fall off. Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me. He kept threatening to tell her what really bit me — I’ve told her it was a dog, but I don’t think she believes me — I shouldn’t have hit him at the Quidditch match, that’s why he’s doing this. Charlie They’ll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George have lost loads of points in all the time they’ve been here, and people still like them. Well — no, Snape’s done it, then! Maybe Snape’s found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid, I bet there’s a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three-headed dog. If we just do a bit of poking around — “Stop saying the name!” “Will you stop saying the name!” “Where’re you going?” “What are you talking about?” “Yes, please,” “You’re mad! “Better get the Cloak,” “You’ll understand later, Neville,” “Don’t be stupid,” “Keep playing,” “All right.” Nothing — just black — there’s no way of climbing down, we’ll just have to drop.” “Right,” “What’s this stuff?” “Lucky this plant thing’s here, really,” “Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s a great help,” “Can you hear something?” “Do you think it’s a ghost?” “There’s light ahead — I can see something moving.” “Do you think they’ll attack us if we cross the room?” Now what?” “But there are hundreds of them!” “Now, don’t be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess —” “Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, you go there instead of that castle.” “I’m going to be a knight,” “Do you want to stop Snape or not?” “Look, if you don’t hurry up, he’ll already have the Stone!” Here I go — now, don’t hang around once you’ve won.” I always said he was off his rocker, D’you think he meant you to do it? Sending you your father’s Cloak and everything? Yeah, Dumbledore’s off his rocker, all right, Listen, you’ve got to be up for the end-of-year feast tomorrow. The points are all in and Slytherin won, of course — you missed the last Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you — but the food’ll be good. What’s been going on? He works for the Ministry, Oh, this doesn’t count, We’re only borrowing this. It’s Dad’s, we didn’t enchant it. But doing magic in front of those Muggles you live with — Stop gibbering, We’ve come to take you home with us. We don’t need to, You forget who I’ve got with me. Get in, Where is it? Put your foot down, Fred! I’m glad we came to get you, anyway, I was getting really worried when you didn’t answer any of my letters. I thought it was Errol’s fault at first — Our owl. He’s ancient. It wouldn’t be the first time he’d collapsed on a delivery. So then I tried to borrow Hermes — But Percy wouldn’t lend him to me, Said he needed him. Er, no, he had to work tonight. Hopefully we’ll be able to get it back in the garage without Mum noticing we flew it. He works in the most boring department, The Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office. It’s all to do with bewitching things that are Muggle-made, you know, in case they end up back in a Muggle shop or house. Like, last year, some old witch died and her tea set was sold to an antiques shop. This Muggle woman bought it, took it home, and tried to serve her friends tea in it. It was a nightmare — Dad was working overtime for weeks. The teapot went berserk and squirted boiling tea all over the place and one man ended up in the hospital with the sugar tongs clamped to his nose. It’s not much, Ginny, This is what you have to do, It doesn’t hurt them — you’ve just got to make them really dizzy so they can’t find their way back to the gnomeholes.” The Chudley Cannons, Ninth in the league. It’s a bit small, Not like that room you had with the Muggles. And I’m right underneath the ghoul in the attic; he’s always banging on the pipes and groaning. . . . He’s never traveled by Floo powder, Sorry, Harry, I forgot. And keep your elbows tucked in, Don’t fidget, Meet you back here, Let’s go together, we’ve only got a minute I dunno — Can’t hear a thing, What’re we going to do? I don’t know how long it’ll take Mum and Dad to get back to us. We can fly the car to Hogwarts! Come on, Skip the lecture, and tell us the new password. Errol!” “It’s not that — it’s that.” “She’s — she’s sent me a Howler,” Aren’t you finished yet? You’ll pay for that one, Malfoy! It’s about the most insulting thing he could think of, Mudblood’s a really foul name for someone who is Muggle-born — you know, non-magic parents. There are some wizards — like Malfoy’s family — who think they’re better than everyone else because they’re what people call pure-blood. I mean, the rest of us know it doesn’t make any difference at all. Look at Neville Longbottom — he’s pure-blood and he can hardly stand a cauldron the right way up. It’s a disgusting thing to call someone, Dirty blood, see. Common blood. It’s ridiculous. Most wizards these days are half-blood anyway. If we hadn’t married Muggles we’d’ve died out. No thanks, Better not risk it. Filch’ll have me there all night, No magic! There must be about a hundred cups in that room. I’m no good at Muggle cleaning. “Look, food!” “Can we move? I feel sick,” “Oh, yeah —” I can’t stand much more of this, Harry, what’re you — ? Harry, what’re we — We weren’t hungry, No, Hearing voices no one else can hear isn’t a good sign, even in the Wizarding world. Hermione, let me read your composition, I only need another two inches, come on — “That’s where Filch has been keeping guard,” “I — don’t — like — spiders,” “Already dead,” Let’s think, Who do we know who thinks Muggle-borns are scum? They could’ve had the key to the Chamber of Secrets for centuries! Handing it down, father to son. . . . If, in a month or so, you feel like explaining, you will let us know, won’t you? What’s that? D’you think we’ve got nothing better to do in Potions than listen to Snape? I never thought I’d see the day when you’d be persuading us to break rules, All right, we’ll do it. But not toenails, okay? It’ll be a lot less hassle if you can just knock Malfoy off his broom tomorrow. “Wouldn’t it be good if they finished each other off?” Hermione — you’re not supposed to be in here — “That could go seriously wrong —” Have you ever heard of a plan where so many things could go wrong? Now what? Urgh — essence of Millicent Bulstrode, Bet it tastes disgusting. Good thinking, We’ll take separate stalls. This is unbelievable, Unbelievable. Hermione, we know Millicent Bulstrode’s ugly, no one’s going to know it’s you “Eh?” How’s this? “The Slytherins always come up to breakfast from over there,” “Percy,” “Stomachache,” “What’s up?” Uh-oh, Is Lockhart the smarmiest bloke you’ve ever met, or what? You don’t think someone else’s been attacked? Now what’s up with her? You’d be surprised, Some of the books the Ministry’s confiscated — Dad’s told me — there was one that burned your eyes out. And everyone who read Sonnets of a Sorcerer spoke in limericks for the rest of their lives. And some old witch in Bath had a book that you could never stop reading! You just had to wander around with your nose in it, trying to do everything one-handed. And — Because Filch made me polish his shield about fifty times in detention, That was the one I burped slugs all over. If you’d wiped slime off a name for an hour, you’d remember it, too. If it has, it’s hiding them very well, Maybe it’s shy. I don’t know why you don’t chuck it, Harry. Could’ve been anything, Maybe he got thirty O. W.L.s or saved a teacher from the giant squid. Maybe he murdered Myrtle; that would’ve done everyone a favor. . . . Yeah . . . So? That’s a brilliant theory, Hermione, with just one tiny little flaw. There’s nothing written in his diary. What’s up? “How many monsters d’you think this place can hold?”  “Riddle does sound like Percy — who asked him to squeal on Hagrid, anyway?” “You met Hagrid down Knockturn Alley, didn’t you, Harry?” “Not the way Lockhart teaches it,”  “I haven’t learned anything from him except not to set pixies loose.” Loads more than I do, Because that’s what Hermione does, When in doubt, go to the library. But McGonagall said we’ve got to stay in our tower unless we’re in class — “That’s clever of you,” “Oh, yes he would,” “Okay,” I’m ready. Let’s go.” We’ve come this far, Come on! I wondered where it had gone! What? “What?” “Prepare his class,” “Gone to curl his hair, more like.” “Wonder if she did see the attacker, though?” “Try and get it out, “And Mrs. Norris?” “Say something. Something in Parseltongue.” English, Me too, You can go first, Under the lake, probably, Harry — there’s something up there — I’m okay — this git’s not, though — he got blasted by the wand — I’ll try and shift some of this rock, So you can — can get back through. And, Harry — How come you’ve got a sword? But — His memory’s gone, The Memory Charm backfired. Hit him instead of us. Hasn’t got a clue who he is, or where he is, or who we are. I told him to come and wait here. He’s a danger to himself. “No,” Harry! I think Myrtle’s grown fond of you! You’ve got competition, Ginny! Where now? “Harry! HARRY!” Finally! We went to the Leaky Cauldron, but they said you’d left, and we went to Flourish and Blotts, and Madam Malkin’s, and — “Dad,” Probably ’cause it’s you, isn’t it? Mind you, they’d have to dig me up first, because Mum would’ve killed me. Anyway, you can ask Dad yourself this evening. We’re staying at the Leaky Cauldron tonight too! So you can come to King’s Cross with us tomorrow! Hermione’s there as well! Look at this, Brand-new wand. Fourteen inches, willow, containing one unicorn tail-hair. And we’ve got all our books — What about those Monster Books, eh? The assistant nearly cried when we said we wanted two. What are you doing Muggle Studies for?  You already know all about Muggles! How about a nice book? What was that? Where’s Hermione? You bought that monster? And what about Scabbers? He needs rest and relaxation! How’s he going to get it with that thing around? I wonder why, I haven’t touched it, all right? The sooner we get on the train, the better, At least I can get away from Percy at Hogwarts. Now he’s accusing me of dripping tea on his photo of Penelope Clearwater. You know, his girlfriend. What were you saying? You won’t, What about poor Scabbers, eh? Go away, Ginny, Who d’you reckon he is? How d’you know that? Wonder what he teaches? Well, I hope he’s up to it, He looks like one good hex would finish him off, doesn’t he? Anyway . . . What were you going to tell us? How thick would Harry have to be, to go looking for a nutter who wants to kill him? No one knows how he got out of Azkaban, No one’s ever done it before. And he was a top-security prisoner too. “What’s that noise?”  It’s coming from your trunk, Harry, Yeah . . . mind you, it’s a very cheap one, It went haywire just as I was tying it to Errol’s leg to send it to Harry. No! Well . . . I wasn’t supposed to be using Errol. You know he’s not really up to long journeys . . . but how else was I supposed to get Harry’s present to him? We could get it checked in Hogsmeade, They sell that sort of thing in Dervish and Banges, magical instruments and stuff. Fred and George told me. Yeah, I think it is, but that’s not why I want to go. I just want to get inside Honeydukes! It’s this sweetshop, where they’ve got everything. . . . Pepper Imps — they make you smoke at the mouth — and great fat Chocoballs full of strawberry mousse and clotted cream, and really excellent sugar quills, which you can suck in class and just look like you’re thinking what to write next — — and massive sherbet balls that make you levitate a few inches off the ground while you’re sucking them, What d’you mean? You’re not allowed to come? But — no way — McGonagall or someone will give you permission — — or we can ask Fred and George, they know every secret passage out of the castle — Don’t let that thing out! Get out of here! D’you think we should wake him up? He looks like he could do with some food. I suppose he is asleep? I mean — he hasn’t died, has he? Really, We must be nearly there, “Great,” I’m starving. I want to get to the feast. . . . So why’re we stopping? What’s going on? There’s something moving out there, I think people are coming aboard. . . . Who’s that? Who’s that? Are you okay? No one screamed, You went sort of rigid and fell out of your seat and started twitching — I felt weird, Like I’d never be cheerful again. . . . No, Ginny was shaking like mad, though. . . . Malfoy, Ah, But look, see this morning? Nine o’clock, Divination. And underneath, nine o’clock, Muggle Studies. And look — underneath that, Arithmancy, nine o’clock. I mean, I know you’re good, Hermione, but no one’s that good. How’re you supposed to be in three classes at once? Well, then — But — Wonder what he’s been getting ready? We’d better go, look, Divination’s at the top of North Tower. It’ll take us ten minutes to get there. . . . There’s — got — to — be — a — shortcut, Can’t be, That’s south, look, you can see a bit of the lake out of the window . . . Yeah, we’ll call you, if we ever need someone mental. After you, Where is she? Right, What can you see in mine? You need your Inner Eye tested, if you ask me, My turn . . . I thought that was a bowler hat, Well, you can’t say it wasn’t an interesting first day back, If we hurried, we could go down and see him. It’s still quite early. . . . There’s nothing wrong with your arm, But, sir — ! None of your business, Keep talking, Malfoy, and I’ll give you a real injury, Not too far from here . . . , What, Malfoy? Need something else skinned? What are you talking about, Malfoy? He’s making it up, He’s trying to make you do something stupid. . . . Take its legs off. . . Riddikulus! Riddikulus! First Hogsmeade weekend, End of October. Halloween. Black’s not fool enough to try anything in Hogsmeade, Ask McGonagall if you can go this time, Harry. The next one might not be for ages — He can’t be the only third year left behind, Ask McGonagall, go on, Harry — Does he have to eat that in front of us? Just keep him over there, that’s all, You can copy mine, if you like, OY! GET OFF, YOU STUPID ANIMAL!” CATCH THAT CAT! Look at him! He’s skin and bone! You keep that cat away from him! There’s something funny about that animal! It heard me say that Scabbers was in my bag! That cat’s got it in for Scabbers! And Scabbers was here first, and he’s ill! There’s always the feast, You know, the Halloween feast, in the evening. By the sound of it — everywhere. Dervish and Banges, the wizarding equipment shop, Zonko’s Joke Shop, into the Three Broomsticks for foaming mugs of hot butterbeer, and many places besides. The post office, Harry! About two hundred owls, all sitting on shelves, all color-coded depending on how fast you want your letter to get there! Honeydukes has got a new kind of fudge; they were giving out free samples, there’s a bit, look — We think we saw an ogre, honestly, they get all sorts at the Three Broomsticks — Wish we could have brought you some butterbeer, really warms you up — Lupin drank it? Is he mad? You asked us a question and she knows the answer! Why ask if you don’t want to be told? Then he magicked you onto a stretcher, And walked up to school with you floating on it. Everyone thought you were . . . Er — Hmm . . . It — it doesn’t like being hit. If Snape’s teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts again, I’m skiving off, Check who’s in there, Hermione. How about these? Wow! you’ve learned to Apparate! How come Fred and George never gave it to me! I’m their brother! Are you mad? Hand in something that good? See? I’d like to see Black try and break into Honeydukes with dementors swarming all over the village. Anyway, Hermione, the Honeydukes owners would hear a break-in, wouldn’t they? They live over the shop! He’d have a job spotting Harry in this, Come on, Hermione, it’s Christmas. Harry deserves a break. Gone! It’s the first day of the holidays, remember? It’s nearly lunchtime; I was going to come and wake you up in a minute. Like trying to go after Black, So what are you saying? Say You-Know-Who, will you? Look, it’s the holidays! It’s nearly Christmas! Let’s — let’s go down and see Hagrid. We haven’t visited him for ages! Or we could have a game of chess, or Gobstones. Percy left a set — There’s a weird noise, Listen — is that Fang? Think we’d better go and get someone? Hagrid! Er — shall I make a cup of tea? It’s what my mum does whenever someone’s upset, Yeah, they’re great! Er — how are the flobberworms? Oh no! Oi! Presents! Another sweater from Mum . . . maroon again . . . see if you’ve got one. What’s that? I don’t believe it, Who sent it to you? Nothing! Blimey, who’d spend that much on you? I bet it was Dumbledore, He sent you the Invisibility Cloak anonymously. . . . That’s why he wouldn’t say it was from him! In case some git like Malfoy said it was favoritism. Hey, Harry Malfoy! Wait till he sees you on this! He’ll be sick as a pig! This is an international standard broom, this is! I know, I know who it could’ve been — Lupin! Yeah, but he likes you, And he was away when your Nimbus got smashed, and he might’ve heard about it and decided to visit Diagon Alley and get this for you — Well, I was there, cleaning out the bedpans on that detention from Snape, remember? Don’t bring him in here! What’s the matter with you? It’s the best broom there is, Hermione, Probably cost more than all the Slytherins’ brooms put together, Who cares? Listen, Harry, can I have a go on it? Can I? What? GET — HIM — OUT — OF — HERE! You’d better take that cat out of here, Hermione, Can’t you shut that thing up? It’s stress! He’d be fine if that big stupid furball left him alone! Dunno, Probably trying to see if she can take any more classes, Scurvy cur, Strip it down? What did you go running to McGonagall for? Still looks ill, doesn’t he? And what are you tutting at us for? Yes, you were, I said I wonder what’s wrong with Lupin, and you — If you don’t want to tell us, don’t, She doesn’t know, She’s just trying to get us to talk to her again. How’s she doing it? Getting to all her classes! I heard her talking to Professor Vector, that Arithmancy witch, this morning. They were going on about yesterday’s lesson, but Hermione can’t’ve been there, because she was with us in Care of Magical Creatures! And Ernie Macmillan told me she’s never missed a Muggle Studies class, but half of them are at the same time as Divination, and she’s never missed one of them either! She gave it to you? Excellent! Listen, can I still have a go on it? Tomorrow? Okay, See, Hermione? There wasn’t anything wrong with it! I’ll take it! I’ve got to give Scabbers his rat tonic. LOOK! LOOK! LOOK! BLOOD! HE’S GONE! AND YOU KNOW WHAT WAS ON THE FLOOR? He bit Goyle for us once! Remember, Harry? Great! Can I try and shoot a few goals on it? Did you see his face? He can’t believe it! This is brilliant! Yes! Yes!  Yes! Yes! If Scabbers hadn’t just been eaten, he could have had some of those Fudge Flies. He used to really like them — No, If she just acted like she was sorry — but she’ll never admit she’s wrong, Hermione. She’s still acting like Scabbers has gone on vacation or something. Black! Sirius Black! With a knife! Here! Just now! Slashed the curtains! Woke me up! Look at the curtains! I tell you, he was here! I’m telling you, I saw him! Woke me up! In our dormitory! With a knife! Woke me up! I’m telling you — We know he’s not coming in through Honeydukes, We’d’ve heard if the shop had been broken into. . . . I was asleep, and I heard this ripping noise, and I thought it was in my dream, you know? But then there was this draft . . . I woke up and one side of the hangings on my bed had been pulled down. . . . I rolled over . . . and I saw him standing over me . . . like a skeleton, with loads of filthy hair . . . holding this great long knife, must’ve been twelve inches . . . and he looked at me, and I looked at him, and then I yelled, and he scampered. Why, though? Why did he run? Run for it, Neville, He probably wants to hear all about Black! All right, Hagrid! S’pose you want to hear about Saturday night, do you? What about her? — ate Scabbers! If she’d just get rid of that cat, I’d speak to her again! But she’s still sticking up for it! It’s a maniac, and she won’t hear a word against it! Hogsmeade, next weekend! What d’you reckon? Can you hear someone talking, Harry? So now you’re trying to get Harry expelled! Haven’t you done enough damage this year? So how about it? Come on, last time we went you didn’t see anything. You haven’t even been inside Zonko’s yet! What kept you? Even the Hogwarts ghosts avoid it, I asked Nearly Headless Nick . . . he says he’s heard a very rough crowd lives here. No one can get in. Fred and George tried, obviously, but all the entrances are sealed shut. . . . Very haunted up here, isn’t it? Harry! you’d better run for it! If Malfoy tells anyone — you’d better get back to the castle, quick — It’s my fault, I persuaded you to go. Lupin’s right, it was stupid, we shouldn’t’ve done it — Come to have a good gloat? Or have you just been to tell on us? “Where’s Hermione gone?” She could’ve done with a Cheering Charm on her too, You know what, Hermione? I reckon you’re cracking up. You’re trying to do too much. I thought we weren’t starting crystal balls until next term, Yeah, there’s a burn on this table, Someone’s spilled their candle. I don’t need help, It’s obvious what this means. There’s going to be loads of fog tonight. You’ve got a Firebolt! Huh? What? What’re you on about? Does that mean the appeal’s already happened? Then you might not have to witness an execution at all! The hippogriff might get off! Why’d you stop me? Did you see them? They’ve even got the axe ready! This isn’t justice! Nope, Rubbish, Couldn’t see a thing, so I made some stuff up. Don’t think she was convinced, though. . . . Buckbeak lost, Hagrid’s just sent this. Sunset, though, We’d never be allowed . . . ’specially you, Harry. . . . She hasn’t gone to get it? Hermione, I don’t know what’s gotten into you lately! First you hit Malfoy, then you walk out on Professor Trelawney — Hagrid What are you talking about? What? Scabbers, what are you doing here? Scabbers! No cats! There’s nothing here to hurt you! We’ll tell them what really happened — We can’t, He’ll be in worse trouble if they know we’ve been to see him. . . . Come on, Scabbers, keep still, What’s the matter with you, you stupid rat? Stay still — OUCH! He bit me! Scabbers — NO! Get away from him — get away — Scabbers, come here — Gotcha! Get off, you stinking cat — Harry, Harry, it’s a trap — Harry, Did you hear me? You’ll have to kill all three of us! “Get away from me, werewolf!” Dumbledore hired you when he knew you were a werewolf? Is he mad? One of us! What? What’s Scabbers got to do with it? What? What’s my rat got to do with anything? What d’you mean — of course he’s a rat — You’re both mental. You’re nutters, both of you, I’ve had enough of this. I’m off. This place is haunted! Come off it, Are you trying to say he broke out of Azkaban just to get his hands on Scabbers? I mean . . . What about it? Look, Scabbers probably had a fight with another rat or something! He’s been in my family for ages, right — We — we’ve been taking good care of him! He’s been scared of that mad cat! What are you going to do with him if I give him to you? I let you sleep in my bed! That’s better, And me, Harry? Why are we in here? Where’s Sirius? Where’s Lupin? What’s going on? What are we doing here? Has something gone wrong? the Burrow! the Burrow! He knows where he’s sleeping, in my room, he slept there last — Well, Right. Mum found this stack of order forms when she was cleaning Fred and George’s room, Great long price lists for stuff they’ve invented. Joke stuff, you know. Fake wands and trick sweets, loads of stuff. It was brilliant, I never knew they’d been inventing all that . . . Only, most of the stuff — well, all of it, really — was a bit dangerous, and, you know, they were planning to sell it at Hogwarts to make some money,  and Mum went mad at them. Told them they weren’t allowed to make any more of it, and burned all the order forms. . . . She’s furious at them anyway. They didn’t get as many O. W.L.s as she expected. We’re not thundering, We’re walking. Sorry if we’ve disturbed the top-secret workings of the Ministry of Magic. That’ll change the world, that report will, Shut up, Pig, Fred and George are in here with us, because Bill and Charlie are in their room, Percy gets to keep his room all to himself because he’s got to work. Yep, Ginny named him, She reckons it’s sweet. And I tried to change it, but it was too late, he won’t answer to anything else. So now he’s Pig. I’ve got to keep him up here because he annoys Errol and Hermes. He annoys me too, come to that. Enjoying it? I don’t reckon he’d come home if Dad didn’t make him. He’s obsessed. Just don’t get him onto the subject of his boss. . . Mr. Crouch is of the opinion . . . Mr. Crouch was telling me . . . They’ll be announcing their engagement any day now. And have you heard from — ? So — have you heard from Sirius lately? Er — is it my eyes, or has everything gone green? Like we’d say anything else surrounded by that lot. Krum, Krum! ‘Really grumpy’? Who cares what he looks like? He’s unbelievable. He’s really young too. Only just eighteen or something. He’s a genius, you wait until tonight, you’ll see. ’Spect they go to some foreign school, I know there are others. Never met anyone who went to one, though. Bill had a penfriend at a school in Brazil . . . this was years and years ago . . . and he wanted to go on an exchange trip but Mum and Dad couldn’t afford it. Met a few people, You not got that fire started yet? Been saving my pocket money all summer for this, Wish I hadn’t bought this now, No — don’t bother, Fair enough, So that’s a house-elf? Weird things, aren’t they? Wild! I can make that old bloke down there pick his nose again . . . and again . . . and again . . . Slimy gits, Huh? Excellent! There you go, for the Omnioculars! Now you’ve got to buy me a Christmas present, ha! That’s him, that’s him! Time-out! Ah, come on, he can’t play like that, look at him — They’re not! What did he catch the Snitch for? He ended it when Ireland were a hundred and sixty points ahead, the idiot! That’s sick, That is really sick. . . . Tripped over a tree root, You watch your mouth! I’ll bet you anything his dad is one of that masked lot! Er — what? Fred and George can’t have gone that far, Maybe it’s back in the tent, What happened? Why can’t she run properly? Well, the elves are happy, aren’t they? You heard old Winky back at the match . . . ‘House-elves is not supposed to have fun’ . . . that’s what she likes, being bossed around. . . . Let’s just keep moving, shall we? Did I tell you I’ve invented a broomstick that’ll reach Jupiter? Well — there’s a sort of riot going on, At the campsite . . . some people have got hold of a family of Muggles. . . . He was a great Beater, though, The Wimbourne Wasps won the league three times in a row while he was with them. They’ll be fine, That’d wipe the smirk off old Draco’s face, all right, They will, They’ll find a way. What the — ? We didn’t do anything! What did you want to attack us for? Yeah, Look, can someone just explain what that skull thing was? It wasn’t hurting anyone. . . . Why’s it such a big deal? I don’t get it, I mean . . . it’s still only a shape in the sky. . . . Yeah, Dad, we met Draco Malfoy in the woods, and he as good as told us his dad was one of those nutters in masks! And we all know the Malfoys were right in with You-Know-Who! But if they were the Death Eaters, why did they Disapparate when they saw the Dark Mark? They’d have been pleased to see it, wouldn’t they? Yeah . . . think I will too, Hermione? What’s up, Harry? But — he wasn’t there, was he? You-Know-Who? I mean — last time your scar kept hurting, he was at Hogwarts, wasn’t he? It was only a dream, Just a nightmare. Don’t — say — his — name! Good thinking! I bet Sirius’ll know what to do! Come and have a game of Quidditch in the orchard, Harry, Come on — three on three, Bill and Charlie and Fred and George will play. . . . You can try out the Wronski Feint. . . . Nah, it would’ve been in the Daily Prophet, The Ministry would want to show they’d caught someone, wouldn’t they? Look, here’s the stuff Mum got for you in Diagon Alley. And she’s got some gold out of your vault for you . . . and she’s washed all your socks. What is that supposed to be? Mum, you’ve given me Ginny’s new dress, What You’ve got to be kidding, I’m not wearing that, no way. Never. I’ll go starkers before I put that on, Well, they’re okay! Why couldn’t I have some like that? I’m not wearing that, no way. Never. Why is everything I own rubbish? A bit of what? Mum! What d’you three know that we don’t? Bagman wanted to tell us what’s happening at Hogwarts, At the World Cup, remember? But my own mother won’t say. Wonder what — I think I’ve heard of it, Where is it? What country? Come off it, Durmstrang’s got to be about the same size as Hogwarts — how are you going to hide a great big castle? Just you, then, So go on — how d’you hide a place like Hogwarts? So Durmstrang’ll just look like a ruin to an outsider too? Come again? Ah, think of the possibilities, It would’ve been so easy to push Malfoy off a glacier and make it look like an accident. . . . Shame his mother likes him. . . . It was, Look at this, Neville. . . . We saw him right up close, as well, Eat dung, Malfoy! What are you talking about? Him! Get to me! ? As if! Oh hurry up, I could eat a hippogriff. Sings a different one every year, It’s got to be a pretty boring life, hasn’t it, being a hat? I suppose it spends all year making up the next one. Oh hurry up, ’Course it is, if you’re dead, About time, Aaah, ’at’s be’er, Yeah, we thought Peeves seemed hacked off about something, So what did he do in the kitchens? Oh c’mon, ’Er-my-knee, Oops — sorry, ’Arry — You won’t get them sick leave by starving yourself! Treacle tart, Hermione! Spotted dick, look! Chocolate gateau! Must be, Dunno, Yeah, Yeah, a thousand Galleons . . . Dumbledore knows you’re not of age, though, What d’you reckon? Be cool to enter, wouldn’t it? But I s’pose they might want someone older. . . . Dunno if we’ve learned enough. . . . Shut it, you, Mental, I might go in for it, you know, if Fred and George find out how to . . . the tournament . . . you never know, do you? Today’s not bad . . . outside all morning, Herbology with the Hufflepuffs and Care of Magical Creatures . . . damn it, we’re still with the Slytherins. . . . You’re eating again, I notice, Yeah . . . and you were hungry, Harry! Aaaaah, when two Neptunes appear in the sky, it is a sure sign that a midget in glasses is being born, Harry. . . . Can I have a look at Uranus too, Lavender? Miserable old bat, That’ll take all weekend, that will. . . . Well, bully for Professor Vector, What? Don’t talk to me, Because I want to fix that in my memory forever, Hermione! you’re ruining the best moment of my life! The what? We haven’t got him till Thursday! You know why Snape’s in such a foul mood, don’t you? Imagine if Moody turned Snape into a horned toad, and bounced him all around his dungeon. . . . What, aren’t you staying? Er, my dad told me about one. . . . Is it called the Imperius Curse, or something? Not the ruddy library again? Ah, Attacks first and asks questions later — look at his dustbins. Balderdash. I s’pose, You know, I think it’s back to the old Divination standby. Yeah, Next Monday, I am likely to develop a cough, owing to the unlucky conjunction of Mars and Jupiter. You know her — just put in loads of misery, she’ll lap it up. Right then, we’re seeing the skrewts again on Monday. Okay, Tuesday, I’ll . . . erm . . . Good one, Because of . . . erm . .Mercury. Why don’t you get stabbed in the back by someone you thought was a friend? Ah, Okay, I’ll lose a bet. She’s got an answer! Harry — Harry — what’s up? What are you on about? Drop it, Yeah, I know, Talk about paranoid . . . No wonder they were glad to get shot of him at the Ministry. Did you hear him telling Seamus what he did to that witch who shouted ‘Boo’ behind him on April Fools’ Day? And when are we supposed to read up on resisting the Imperius Curse with everything else we’ve got to do? Cedric? That idiot, Hogwarts champion? You only like him because he’s handsome, Lockhart! Who’s avoiding you? What’s a bummer? Harry You know, I bet we could do them, Harry. We’ve done dangerous stuff before. . . . What are you on about? Why d’you have to keep changing owls? Nearly six, How d’you reckon they’re coming? The train? A Portkey? Or they could Apparate — maybe you’re allowed to do it under seventeen wherever they come from? Skrewts, Maybe they’ve escaped, Only a Quidditch player? Hermione — he’s one of the best Seekers in the world! I had no idea he was still at school! I’m getting his autograph if I can, You haven’t got a quill, have you, Harry? Anyone put their name in yet? What? You’re kidding! ’Course she is, can’t see a beard, can you? What’re we going to do today, then? Okay, just as long as he doesn’t ask us to donate a few fingers to the skrewts. What is it with her? What d’you reckon’ll happen to the ones who aren’t chosen? Reckon they’ll go back to school, or hang around to watch the tournament? Where are they sleeping, then? Oh good, hurry up, Hagrid, what’s that? Look! He fancies her! Well, if they end up having children, they’ll be setting a world record — bet any baby of theirs would weigh about a ton. No surprises there! No! Hermione! Hermione! Look! You’ve had an owl, And we’ve got to do our detentions tomorrow night, Snape’s dungeon, Who were you talking to? Sorry about that, Should’ve realized you didn’t want to be disturbed. I’ll let you get on with practicing for your next interview in peace. Harry, whoever put your name in that goblet — I — I reckon they’re trying to do you in! No, Harry, Harry, c’mon, they’ll be putting up your scores. . . . You were the best, you know, no competition. Cedric did this weird thing where he Transfigured a rock on the ground . . . turned it into a dog . . . he was trying to make the dragon go for the dog instead of him. Well, it was a pretty cool bit of Transfiguration, and it sort of worked, because he did get the egg, but he got burned as well — the dragon changed its mind halfway through and decided it would rather have him than the Labrador; he only just got away. And that Fleur girl tried this sort of charm, I think she was trying to put it into a trance — well, that kind of worked too, it went all sleepy, but then it snored, and this great jet of flame shot out, and her skirt caught fire — she put it out with a bit of water out of her wand. And Krum — you won’t believe this, but he didn’t even think of flying! He was probably the best after you, though. Hit it with some sort of spell right in the eye. Only thing is, it went trampling around in agony and squashed half the real eggs — they took marks off for that, he wasn’t supposed to do any damage to them. It’s marks out of ten from each one, Not bad! I suppose she took marks off for your shoulder. . . . Looking good! Harry, What? Four? You lousy, biased scumbag, you gave Krum ten! Blast-Ended Skrewts, Worst that can happen is Hagrid’ll have to get rid of the skrewts. Sorry . . . did I say worst? I meant best. An ugly old bat in outsize specs? Wonder where she’s got to? Yeah, thanks! Good service! Tell you what, Dobby, I’ll give you the one my mum knits me this Christmas, I always get one from her. You don’t mind maroon, do you? We might have to shrink it a bit to fit you, but it’ll go well with your tea cozy. You know what? All these years I’ve been really impressed with Fred and George, nicking food from the kitchens — well, it’s not exactly difficult, is it? They can’t wait to give it away! She seems to love him, I’d still rather work for him than old Crouch, At least Bagman’s got a sense of humor. Yeah, well, Percy wouldn’t want to work for anyone with a sense of humor, would he? Percy wouldn’t recognize a joke if it danced naked in front of him wearing Dobby’s tea cozy. She was quite good-looking, She wants a new angle, Hagrid, You were supposed to say Harry’s a mad delinquent! You coming to this ball thing on Christmas Day, Hagrid? Evil, he is, Springing a test on us on the last day. Ruining the last bit of term with a whole load of studying. Leave him alone, Hermione, he’s earned a bit of a break, Harry — we’ve just got to grit our teeth and do it, When we get back to the common room tonight, we’ll both have partners — agreed? Why did I do it? I don’t know what made me do it! I don’t know what made me do it! What was I playing at? There were people — all around — I’ve gone mad — everyone watching! I was just walking past her in the entrance hall — she was standing there talking to Diggory — and it sort of came over me — and I asked her! She looked at me like I was a sea slug or something. Didn’t even answer. And then — I dunno — I just sort of came to my senses and ran for it. This is mad, We’re the only ones left who haven’t got anyone — well, except Neville. Hey — guess who he asked? he said, He told me after Potions! Ha! As if! She just didn’t want to go with Neville . . . I mean, who would? Thanks a bunch, Ginny, Well — you can come with one of us! Oh come on, we need partners, we’re going to look really stupid if we haven’t got any, everyone else has . . . No, you’re not! You just said that to get rid of Neville! Okay, okay, we know you’re a girl, That do? Will you come now? She’s lying, Who is it then? Right, this is getting stupid. Ginny, you can go with Harry, and I’ll just — What’s got into them? Hermione, Want a game of chess, Harry? Ah, no, Harry, how come you didn’t spot that? Tell you what, Dobby — here you go — take these two, and you can mix them up properly. And here’s your sweater. They’re only socks, Wow, Harry — Cool! Animal magnetism, Hermione Where’s Hermione? Okay, Viktor? Hasn’t he asked you to call him Vicky yet? If you don’t know, I’m not going to tell you. He’s from Durmstrang! He’s competing against Harry! Against Hogwarts! You — you’re — fraternizing with the enemy, that’s what you’re doing! I s’pose he asked you to come with him while you were both in the library? What happened — trying to get him to join spew, were you? Yeah, well — that’s his story, Obvious, isn’t it? He’s Karkaroff’s student, isn’t he? He knows who you hang around with. . . . He’s just trying to get closer to Harry — get inside information on him — or get near enough to jinx him — Then he’s hoping you’ll help him find out what his egg means! I suppose you’ve been putting your heads together during those cozy little library sessions — You’ve got a funny way of showing it, No it isn’t! It’s about winning! Why don’t you go and find Vicky, he’ll be wondering where you are, No, We’re walking, Not against the law, is it? What’s got Karkaroff all worried? Well, they’re . . . they’re . . . . . . not very nice, I know there isn’t, but . . . blimey, no wonder he keeps it quiet, I always thought he’d got in the way of a bad Engorgement Charm when he was a kid or something. Didn’t like to mention it. . . . But . . . Harry, they’re just vicious, giants. It’s like Hagrid said, it’s in their natures, they’re like trolls . . . they just like killing, everyone knows that. There aren’t any left in Britain now, though. Well, they were dying out anyway, and then loads got themselves killed by Aurors. There’re supposed to be giants abroad, though. . . . They hide out in mountains mostly. . . . Oh yeah? What’s that? Well, Who’re you? Where’s Hagrid? “How did she find out?” “We weren’t trying to hear him!” “Yeah, but there’s still the giant squid,” Er — okay, What did he want? Who cares if Diggory’s getting help? Maybe Percy’s poisoning him, Probably thinks if Crouch snuffs it he’ll be made Head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation. Worrying about poor ’ickle goblins, now, are you? Thinking of starting up S.P. U.G. or something? Society for the Protection of Ugly Goblins? Uh-oh, Yeah, he is, Can I have one of these cakes, Hagrid? Good luck, Snape said Moody’s searched his office as well? What . . . d’you reckon Moody’s here to keep an eye on Snape as well as Karkaroff? What? Harry . . . maybe Moody thinks Snape put your name in the Goblet of Fire! — evil, Come on, Hermione, why are all these Dark wizard catchers searching his office, then? You just don’t like Crouch because of that elf, Winky, What’s he want to know about the next Hogsmeade weekend for? I don’t reckon it can be done, There’s nothing. Harry, Harry, just go down to the lake tomorrow, right, stick your head in, yell at the merpeople to give back whatever they’ve nicked, and see if they chuck it out. Best you can do, mate. Yeah, you could’ve turned into a goldfish any time you wanted! What? “What’re you two doing here?” What? What did you bring her for? Harry, you didn’t take that song thing seriously, did you? Dumbledore wouldn’t have let any of us drown! It was only to make sure you got back inside the time limit! I hope you didn’t waste time down there acting the hero! Gerroff, Percy, I’m all right! Yeah, Yeah, yeah, a bit — Known what? You haven’t been mixing up Love Potions, have you? Known what? And what did you say? And what did you say? My brother’s Crouch’s personal assistant, He says Crouch is suffering from overwork. Hermione’s obsessed with house-elves, The Malfoys! Yeah, but he didn’t stay in the forest, did he? The moment we told him about the riot, he went off to the campsite. Come off it, Hermione, will you give it a rest with the elf! And he sneaked up here to search Snape’s office! Yeah, it does! Oh give it a rest, Hermione, I know Dumbledore’s brilliant and everything, but that doesn’t mean a really clever Dark wizard couldn’t fool him — I dunno — maybe he thought Dumbledore would kick him out — Snape knows Karkaroff pretty well, but he wants to keep that quiet, Why are Moody and Crouch so keen to get into Snape’s office then? I can try, Better not make it sound like I reckon Crouch is up to anything dodgy, though. Percy loves Crouch. No chance of more of those eclairs, is there? Good idea, Give Pig something to do. You couldn’t give us a bit of extra food, could you? You couldn’t keep your mouth shut, could you, Hermione? They won’t want us visiting them now! We could’ve tried to get more stuff out of Winky about Crouch! She had to go to the hospital wing, Can you buy these as pets, Hagrid? No, Why didn’t you tell me about the gold? The gold I gave you at the Quidditch World Cup, The leprechaun gold I gave you for my Omnioculars. In the Top Box. Why didn’t you tell me it disappeared? Must be nice, To have so much money you don’t notice if a pocketful of Galleons goes missing. I didn’t know leprechaun gold vanishes, I thought I was paying you back. You shouldn’t’ve given me that Chudley Cannon hat for Christmas. I hate being poor. It’s rubbish, I don’t blame Fred and George for trying to make some extra money. Wish I could. Wish I had a niffler. Hermione, is there any point in telling you to drop this? Bugged? What . . . put fleas on her or something? What’s the point? You know it by heart, we can just ask you. Haven’t we got enough to worry about? Yeah, Gets it for the recipes. It must’ve been Crouch, That’s why he was gone when Harry and Dumbledore got there. He’d done a runner. Okay . . . how’s this for a theory, Krum attacked Crouch — no, wait for it — and then Stunned himself! Oh yeah . . . And . . . remind me what he said about You-Know-Who? He was out of his mind, Maybe he didn’t want you to get there! Maybe — hang on — how fast d’you reckon he could’ve gotten down to the forest? D’you reckon he could’ve beaten you and Dumbledore there? Wouldn’t put it past him, Unless Crouch was already outside the grounds, because it only shows up to the boundaries, doesn’t — Who’re you blackmailing? Didn’t sound like that, It’s my business if you’re blackmailing someone, George’s right, you could end up in serious trouble for that. No, I won’t! Well . . . I dunno if they would. They’re . . It’s this joke shop idea they’ve got, I thought they were only saying it to annoy Mum, but they really mean it, they want to start one. Wouldn’t they? I dunno . . . they don’t exactly mind breaking rules, do they? Are you mad? Tell Percy? He’d probably do a Crouch and turn them in. Come on, let’s get some breakfast. So he did Disapparate? Yeah, someone could’ve — could’ve pulled him onto a broom and flown off with him, couldn’t they? So, said Ron, d’you reckon he’s somewhere in Hogsmeade? We helped, Me and Hermione helped. Harry! Harry! You all right? Dumbledore reckons You-Know-Who’s getting stronger again as well?  And he trusts Snape? He really trusts Snape, even though he knows he was a Death Eater? How can you be worrying about her now? Yeah, but Bagman didn’t pass information on purpose, did he? And Fudge reckons Madame Maxime attacked Crouch? We never thought of her, did we? Mind you, she’s definitely got giant blood, and she doesn’t want to admit it — What? “No, “No, “No,” “No,” “Are you all right?” Mum — Bill! What’re you doing here? Oh . . . okay, Couldn’t remember all the goblin rebels’ names, so I invented a few. It’s all right, Mum, shut up! It’s okay! Who? You two made up, have you? It’s very good already, Wonder how the Durmstrang students are getting back, D’you reckon they can steer that ship without Karkaroff? You’d better hurry up! The carriages’ll be here in a minute! What are you talking about? How did you find out? You’re kidding, You haven’t . . . she’s not . . . That’s never — you’re kidding — When we saw Malfoy under that tree . . . Well, what, then? But that was all your savings! Let him breathe, Hermione, She’s been in a right state, Pecked us half to death when she brought your last letters, look at this — We wanted to give them to you, mate, I think he thought you were safest with the Muggles — Well, no — but that’s why he’s had people from the Order of the Phoenix tailing you all the time — We told Dumbledore we wanted to tell you what was going on, We did, mate. Don’t be thick, We’re not! Mum won’t let us near the meetings, she says we’re too young — Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix, — we’ve met about twenty of them, but we think there are more . . . Er, Well what? Fred and George have invented Extendable Ears, see, They’re really useful. Ears, yeah. Only we’ve had to stop using them lately because Mum found out and went berserk. Fred and George had to hide them all to stop Mum binning them. But we got a good bit of use out of them before Mum realized what was going on. We know some of the Order are following known Death Eaters, keeping tabs on them, you know — — and some of them are standing guard over something, They’re always talking about guard duty. Oh yeah, It would have taken you about thirty seconds longer to walk down the stairs, Doesn’t stop him being a git. The way he looks at us when he sees us . . . Whatever you do, don’t mention Percy in front of Mum and Dad, Order of the Phoenix We were about to come and join the Order. Percy came home and told us he’d been promoted. That’s exactly what we wondered, He came home really pleased with himself — even more pleased than usual if you can imagine that — and told Dad he’d been offered a position in Fudge’s own office. He expected Dad to be all impressed, I think. I know, And it got worse. He said Dad was an idiot to run around with Dumbledore, that Dumbledore was heading for big trouble and Dad was going to go down with him, and that he — Percy — knew where his loyalty lay and it was with the Ministry. And if Mum and Dad were going to become traitors to the Ministry he was going to make sure everyone knew he didn’t belong to our family anymore. And he packed his bags the same night and left. He’s living here in London now. Mum’s been in a right state, You know — crying and stuff. She came up to London to try and talk to Percy but he slammed the door in her face. I dunno what he does if he meets Dad at work — ignores him, I s’pose. Yeah, Percy said the only evidence was your word and . . . I dunno . . . he didn’t think it was good enough. The house-elf who lives here, His life’s ambition is to have his head cut off and stuck up on a plaque just like his mother, Is that normal, Hermione? Yeah, C’mon, I’m starving. Hold it! They’re still in the hall, we might be able to hear something — Snape never eats here, If Harry’s allowed, why can’t I? Harry’ll tell me and Hermione everything you say anyway! Won’t — won’t you? We can’t let them out to hunt every night, Dumbledore doesn’t want too many owls swooping around the square, thinks it’ll look suspicious. Oh yeah . . . I forgot . . . Kreacher, First night I was here he came wandering in at three in the morning. Trust me, you don’t want to wake up and find him prowling around your room. Anyway . . . What d’you reckon? Yeah, OUCH! You two just Apparated on my knees! But there can’t be anything worse than the Avada Kedavra curse, can there? What’s worse than death? Maybe it’s some particularly painful way of killing people, I hope it’s our side, Where? Hogwarts? A weapon’s going to be a lot bigger than the Stone, though! She doesn’t trust us at all, you know, I knew it! You always get away with stuff! ’Course, once Dumbledore turned up on your side, there was no way they were going to convict you, I bet Dumbledore turns up this evening to celebrate with us, you know. That’s a bit harsh you wouldn’t want to be stuck inside this house without company. I thought you might be here to tell us to have a break! D’you know how much mold we’ve got rid of since we arrived here? I feel like a house-elf, I’ll sponsor you to shut up about spew, Booklists have arrived, About time, I thought they’d forgotten, they usually come much earlier than this . . . It’s my name on the letter, Mum . . . don’t . . . Mum, get a grip . . . What? Mum, can I have a new broom? Not a really good one! Just — just a new one for a change . . . SHUT UP! Drop it, Hermione. I don’t think they are, They’ve always said only prats become prefects. . . . Still, they’ve never had new brooms! I wish I could go with Mum and choose. . . . She’ll never be able to afford a Nimbus, but there’s the new Cleansweep out, that’d be great. . . . Yeah, I think I’ll go and tell her I like the Cleansweep, just so she knows . Just caught her! She says she’ll get the Cleansweep if she can. I never thought it would be me! I thought it would be you! Yeah, yeah, I suppose. . . . Well, we’d better get our trunks packed, hadn’t we? . . . the handle’s made of Spanish oak with anti-jinx varnish and in-built vibration control — . . . better hurry up, Mum’s going ballistic, she says we’re going to miss the train . . . Oh lighten up, he hasn’t seen daylight for months, poor bloke. Er, Yeah, definitely, It’s a pain having to go down there, I’d rather — but we have to — I mean, I’m not enjoying it, I’m not Percy, I’m starving, And guess who’s a Slytherin prefect? ’Course, Ernie Macmillan and Hannah Abbott, Yes, We’re supposed to patrol the corridors every so often, and we can give out punishments if people are misbehaving. I can’t wait to get Crabbe and Goyle for something . . . Yes, No, I’m just going to make sure I get his mates before he gets mine. I’ll make Goyle do lines, it’ll kill him, he hates writing, I . . . must . . . not . . . look . . . like . . . a . . . baboon’s . . . backside . . . Are you taking the mickey? Anything good in there? Chuck us another Frog, Where’s Pig? — Hagrid is? I dunno, He’d better be okay . . . I haven’t got Pig yet! What are those things, What things? Well, Well, come on then, let’s get in. . . . what were you saying, Harry? What horse things? What are you talking about? What am I supposed to be looking at? See what? Are you feeling all right, Harry? “Shall we get in, then?” He can’t have left, Yeah . . . yeah, that’ll be it, Nice cardigan, Branched out a bit this year, hasn’t it? Excellent, Ow kunnit nofe skusin danger ifzat? Only because you’re terrified of him, What blood? Surely you haven’t still got — ? “node iddum eentup sechew,” What? I’m not allowed to ask a simple question? You’re not telling me you enjoyed it? That was about the dullest speech I’ve ever heard, and I grew up with Percy. Did it? Well, what does that mean? Oh yeah, Hey — hey you lot! Midgets! Well, they are, they’re titchy . . . Look at today! History of Magic, double Potions, Divination, and double Defense Against the Dark Arts . . . Binns, Snape, Trelawney, and that Umbridge woman all in one day! I wish Fred and George’d hurry up and get those Skiving Snackboxes sorted . . . Look what we’ve got today, That’s the worst Monday I’ve ever seen. Why’s it cheap? Cheers, but I think I’ll take the lessons. Leave me out of it, Yeah . . . you got, what was it, three O. W.L.s each? You know, I’ve been wondering about that, They bought me a new set of dress robes this summer, and I couldn’t understand where they got the Galleons . . . Oh yeah, Bound to be, isn’t it? O.W.L.s are really important, affect the jobs you can apply for and everything. We get career advice too, later this year, Bill told me. So you can choose what N. E.W.T.s you want to do next year. Not really, Except . . . well . . . Well, it’d be cool to be an Auror, But they’re, like, the elite, You’ve got to be really good. What about you, Hermione? We’d fail our O. W.L.s, If you want that on your conscience, Hermione . . . We do try, We just haven’t got your brains or your memory or your concentration — you’re just cleverer than we are — is it nice to rub it in? Is that a Tornados badge? You don’t support them, do you? Have you always supported them, or just since they started winning the league? What? I only asked her if — So? She could’ve done, I wasn’t stopping — Attacking? I wasn’t attacking her, I was only — Who cares if she supports the Tornados? But what does it matter? Poisonous toadstools don’t change their spots, Hermione and me have stopped arguing, said Hermione. I’m just passing on the message, But I reckon she’s right. It’s not our fault how Seamus and Snape treat you. I never remember my dreams, You say one. What? What d’you reckon that means? D’you realize how much homework we’ve got already?  now we’ve got a month’s dream diary from Trelawney!  Fred and George weren’t wrong about O.W.L. year, were they? That Umbridge woman had better not give us any . . . We’re not going to use magic? Weasley, And she’s trying to get people to spy for her, Remember when she said she wanted us to come and tell her if we hear anyone saying You-Know-Who’s back? Shall we do Snape’s stuff first? ‘The properties . . . of moonstone . . . and its uses . . . in potion-making . . .’ There. So what are the properties of moonstone and its uses in potion-making? I — what? No — come on, Hermione — we can’t tell them off for giving out sweets . . . She’s got it under control, You handled it fine by yourself, What in the name of Merlin are you doing? You’re leaving out hats for the house-elves? And you’re covering them up with rubbish first? That’s not on, You’re trying to trick them into picking up the hats. You’re setting them free when they might not want to be free. They should at least see what they’re picking up, Anyway . . . have you?” Harry, don’t go picking a row with Malfoy, don’t forget, he’s a prefect now, he could make life difficult for you . . . What d’you reckon are the odds of Umbridge letting you off on Friday? And it looks like it’s going to rain. Nothing, “doing other stuff,” That’ll have to do, I’ve said I dreamed I was buying a new pair of shoes, she can’t make anything weird out of that, can she? How was detention with Umbridge, anyway? What did she make you do? That’s not too bad, then, eh? Hey — I forgot — did she let you off for Friday? I can’t believe how much homework we’ve got, I was . . . I fancied a walk, What? Er — nothing. What are you doing? I’m — I’m hiding from Fred and George, if you must know, Er, I-I thought I’d try out for Gryffindor Keeper now I’ve got a decent broom. There. Go on. Laugh. I’m not bad, Charlie, Fred, and George always made me Keep for them when they were training during the holidays. Every evening since Tuesday . . . just on my own,  I’ve been trying to bewitch Quaffles to fly at me, but it hasn’t been easy and I don’t know how much use it’ll be. Fred and George are going to laugh themselves stupid when I turn up for the tryouts. They haven’t stopped taking the mickey out of me since I got made a prefect. What? I thought you said she was giving you lines? The old hag! She’s sick! Go to McGonagall, say something! Got to you? You can’t let her get away with this! Dumbledore, then, tell Dumbledore! Why not? Well, I reckon you should — Harry, I did it, I’m in, I’m Keeper! Have a butterbeer. I can’t believe it — where’s Hermione gone? Er, What are you looking so pleased about? Oh . . . yeah . . . Listen . . . you don’t fancy going out a bit earlier with me, do you? Just to — er — give me some practice before training? So I can, you know, get my eye in a bit . . . Anything interesting? What? I’ve got all the robes I want, Sturgis Podmore? but he’s that bloke who looks like his head’s been thatched, isn’t he? He’s one of the Ord — D’you reckon he was doing something for the Order? It could be a frame-up! No — listen! The Ministry suspects he’s one of Dumbledore’s lot so — I dunno — they lured him to the Ministry, and he wasn’t trying to get through a door at all! Maybe they’ve just made something up to get him! I mean, we can do it tonight, And we’ve got tomorrow. She gets too worked up about work, that’s her trouble . . . D’you think she meant it when she said we weren’t copying from her? Yeah, And we have got plenty of time to do it all . . . Yeah, Shut up, Sorry! Oh . . . sorry . . . Oh . . . sorry . . . Completely lousy, Who said it was me who made it lousy? You thought I was bound to be rubbish? I’m going to get started on some homework, Yeah, Listen . . . shall we just ask Hermione if we can have a look at what she’s done? No, Thanks, Yeah, I haven’t got time to listen to a sermon, all right, Hermione, I’m up to my neck in it here — Blimey, it is! What’s Percy writing to me for? That’s definitely Percy’s handwriting, Give it back, git. Come on, we’ve got to get this finished some time before dawn, What? Hermione, you are honestly the most wonderful person I’ve ever met, Harry  Why are you down there? What about — ? All we do is read the stupid textbook, That’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard, including all the stuff that Luna Lovegood comes out with. Oh, I can’t wait to see McGonagall inspected, Umbridge won’t know what’s hit her. I did it last time, it’s your turn, you tell me one. Okay, we’ve got to add your age to the date you had the dream, the number of letters in the subject . . . would that be ‘drowning’ or ‘cauldron’ or ‘Snape’? What night did you dream this again? I know, mate, she’s bang out of order. Excellent, Let’s see Umbridge get what she deserves. Well, it’s a start, I still reckon you should complain about this, McGonagall would go nuts if she knew — I suggested poison, Well, what can we do about that? ’S too late, isn’t it? Come off it, You want us to do extra work? D’you realize Harry and I are behind on homework again and it’s only the second week? I didn’t think there was anything in the universe more important than homework, We can’t do much by ourselves, I mean, all right, we can go and look jinxes up in the library and try and practice them, I suppose — That’s an idea. You, Teaching us to do it. You know what, I’m not sure I want someone this stupid teaching me, Let’s think, Uh . . . first year — you saved the Stone from You-Know-Who. Second year, you killed the basilisk and destroyed Riddle. Third year, Last year, We weren’t saying anything like that, mate, We weren’t having a go at Diggory, we didn’t — you’ve got the wrong end of the — “Coming?” oh, all right, the idea I had, then — about you teaching us. I thought it was a good idea from the start, Yeah? What did Vicky say? You’re not still in contact with him, are you? He didn’t only want to be your pen pal, Why do we have to do it outside school? Well, you can’t blame him for wanting to get out and about, I mean, he’s been on the run for over two years, hasn’t he, and I know that can’t have been a laugh, but at least he was free, wasn’t he? And now he’s just shut up all the time with that lunatic elf. I don’t reckon he’d be stupid enough to turn up, Dumbledore’d go mad if he did and Sirius listens to Dumbledore even if he doesn’t like what he hears. Er — why was Filch sniffing you? You know what? I’ve always wanted to try firewhisky — Oh, Yeah . . . Who are you? Here’s an idea, why don’t you shut your mouth? Yeah, McGonagall might let us have hers, she did when Harry was practicing for the Triwizard . . . I reckon you’ll be okay with Gobstones, I don’t think we’re going to be as lucky, though, do you? She can’t, Zacharias Smith! Let’s go and tell her, Me, I didn’t realize that would happen. It’s not fair! Hermione’s allowed in our dormitory, how come we’re not allowed — ? To see you — look at this! Someone must have blabbed to her! You’re so naive, What’ll happen to them? Here comes Ernie and Hannah Abbott, And those Ravenclaw blokes and Smith . . . and no one looks very spotty. Where did you take her? Who’s the letter from anyway? What in the name of Merlin, was that about? Hark who’s talking, you walked out of Divination, you hate Trelawney! What? She’s given the Slytherins permission, why not us? No real use? Hermione, they’ve got about twenty-six Galleons already . . . Sirius! Why was Dung hiding from us? We’d’ve liked to’ve seen him. On duty doing what? So you want me to say I’m not going to take part in the defense group? Hey, that’s an idea! Silencio! He’s not stupid, he knows she nearly got him. Silencio! Silencio! SILENCIO! Silencio! Silencio! SILENCIO! Ravens are harder than frogs, Silencio! Silencio! SILENCIO! Oh — oh, right, Er — Silencio! Hope this clears up . . . What’s up with you, Hermione? Well, that clears that up, It would’ve been really annoying if you hadn’t explained yourself properly. Hermione, it was your idea in the first place! Yes, you do sound just like my mother. Does it work? I can’t see any boils, — but they make sitting on a broom a right pain in the — What happened? Was it your scar? But . . . He — he can’t be near us now, can he? Did you see him? Did you . . . get a vision, or something? But . . . Is this what it was about last time? When your scar hurt in Umbridge’s office? You-Know-Who was angry? What! You could take over from Trelawney, mate, No, you know what you’re doing? Harry, you’re reading You-Know-Who’s mind. . . . No, You’ve got to tell someone, Well, tell him about this time! Well then, Dumbledore — Dumbledore’d want to know, Mimbulus mimbletonia, These will be good when we’re practicing Stunning, “I did not only get you once, I got you at least three times —” Fat chance, I haven’t got any real Galleons to confuse it with. I must’ve been mental to do this, Mental. I’m rubbish, I’m lousy. I can’t play to save my life. What was I thinking? That was an accident, I didn’t mean to do it — I slipped off my broom when none of you were looking and I was trying to get back on and I kicked the Quaffle by accident. Walking, I’m sorry, For thinking I can play Quidditch, I’m going to resign first thing tomorrow. “What?” This is all my fault — — if I wasn’t so lousy at Quidditch — — it was that song that wound me up — This is the worst I’ve ever felt in my life. Come off it, you’re in a right state! Hagrid, you’ve been attacked! Would you say it was nothing if one of us turned up with a pound of mince instead of a face? You’re not going to eat that, are you, Hagrid? It looks poisonous. It was kind of . . . obvious, Where are they? So why don’t Muggles — ? Are they hidden? Is it a secret, where they are? A month? But — why couldn’t you just grab a Portkey or something? What d’you mean? So you couldn’t use magic to get there? You had to act like Muggles all the way? How big are they? Just like that? You just walked right into a giant camp? How could you tell which one was the Gurg? But didn’t they try and kill you when they saw you? What do you give a giant? Food? And did he like the present? What d’you mean? You went to speak to him? After you’d watched him rip off another giant’s head? Blimey, Hagrid, Death Eaters? How could you tell which ones they were? Giants? Cave must’ve been cramped, Six or seven? Well that’s not bad — are they going to come over here and start fighting You-Know-Who with us? So . . . so there aren’t any giants coming? But you still haven’t explained how you got in this state, Hagrid, Who attacked you? It’s her! “I dunno if you got through to him,” Umbridge said they’re dangerous, I’m surprised so many people could see them, What kept you? What’s up? What’s happened? So — er — what did she want? Well? HA! So? How was it? Oh, Are you that bad at kissing? How do you know? You’d think a bit of kissing would cheer her up, What’s that supposed to mean? What sort of person cries while someone’s kissing them? One person can’t feel all that at once, they’d explode. Don’t blame you, mate, What if he doesn’t want to ask her? Who’re you writing the novel to anyway? Krum? What does she see in Krum? Yeah, but apart from that, I mean he’s a grouchy git, isn’t he? Well, ’night, ’Night, Harry! HARRY! Harry! Harry! What Harry, mate, you . . . you were just dreaming . . . Harry, you’re not well, Neville’s gone for help . . . It wasn’t that, Those Muggle nutters that cut people up? Nah, they’re Healers. Harry, Mum says dinner’s ready, but she’ll save you something if you want to stay in bed . . . You didn’t leave your bed, mate, I saw you thrashing around in your sleep about a minute before we could wake you up . . . No problem, Who’s that for anyway? It had better not be clothes! You know what Sirius said, Kreacher knows too much, we can’t set him free! So, this is Kreacher’s bedroom? He must be sneaking around upstairs, Urgh. And what’s that supposed to be? Watch who you’re calling gruesome! I have not got spattergroit! They’re freckles! Now get back in your own picture and leave me alone! What floor’s this? Blimey! Er — how are you, Professor? Er — we don’t want any at the moment, thanks, Er, actually, we were just — er — Let’s not stay long, Neville! Neville! What? Is that your dad down the end, Neville? What’s he want with you? You haven’t done anything, have you? I’ve changed my mind, I never want to ride on here again. Shall I jinx him? I can still get him from here, So . . . so, are you saying . . . that the weapon — the thing You-Know-Who’s after — is in the Ministry of Magic? Of course what? How come Sturgis was trying to break in when he’s on our side? I know they call the people who work in there ‘Unspeakables,’ Because no one really seems to know what they do in there. . . . Weird place to have a weapon . . . There you are, Harry, That’s why he was happy last night . . . Bode . . . Bode. It rings a bell . . . Who expects Devil’s Snare to turn up in a hospital disguised as a potted plant? It’s not our fault, whoever sent it to the bloke is to blame! They must be a real prat, why didn’t they check what they were buying? I’ve heard Dad talk about him at home! He was an Unspeakable — he worked in the Department of Mysteries! Where are you going? I hate it when she does that, Would it kill her to tell us what she’s up to for once? It’d take her about ten more seconds — hey, Hagrid! You’re on probation? Sorry — I mean — you’re on probation? Reckon they know anything new? Maybe . . . Maybe it’s not Harry’s fault he can’t close his mind, Well, maybe Snape isn’t really trying to help Harry . . . Maybe, he’s actually trying to open Harry’s mind a bit wider . . . make it easier for You-Know — He used to be a Death Eater, And we’ve never seen proof that he really swapped sides . . . You should write a book, translating mad things girls do so boys can understand them. It was a nightmare, What was going on? This one’s from a bloke who thinks you’re off your rocker, Ah well . . . Another one who thinks you’re barking, but this one says you’ve got her converted, and she now thinks you’re a real hero — she’s put in a photograph too — wow — what Has someone been attacked again? Is it Dad? Is it that snake? What are you talking about? D’you mean . . . did you just see You-Know-Who? what Bode was bewitched to remove something? But — Harry, that’s got to be — Did you say, that you were You-Know-Who? Harry, what Impossible, She can’t get any worse than she’s been already. Blimey! He’s not very definite on anything, is he? I mean, I could do with a few more details about this war we’re about to have, couldn’t you? Yeah, we’re prefects too, remember? What do you mean, ‘tried’? But now? Yeah, all right, I dunno . . . there’s been a lot going on . . . You’ve given me an evening off every week! What’s the point? We’ve got about as much chance of winning the Quidditch Cup this year as Dad’s got of becoming Minister of Magic . . . Yeah, well, I don’t blame you! If it hadn’t been for her . . . Well, It says here you need at least an E at N. E.W.T. level in Potions, Herbology, Transfiguration, Charms, and Defense Against the Dark Arts. I mean . . . blimey. . . . Don’t want much, do they? I dunno, If Harry wants to do it, it’s up to him, isn’t it? What sort of diversion is it? ’Course not, he’ll recover, Who cares? Montague shouldn’t have tried to take all those points from Gryffindor, should he? If you want to worry about anyone, Hermione, worry about me! When Mum’s next letter finally gets through Umbridge’s screening process, I’m going to be in deep trouble. I wouldn’t be surprised if she’s sent a Howler again. It’ll be my fault Fred and George left, you wait, She’ll say I should’ve stopped them leaving, I should’ve grabbed the ends of their brooms and hung on or something. . . . Yeah, it’ll be all my fault . . . Yeah, but that’s another thing, how did they get premises? It’s a bit dodgy, isn’t it? But this is excellent! It’s all your fault, Harry — Mum can’t blame me at all! Can I tell her? You were only muttering a bit, Something about ‘just a bit farther. ’ You know, if Montague doesn’t recover before Slytherin play Hufflepuff, we might be in with a chance of winning the Cup. I mean, we’ve won one, lost one — if Slytherin lose to Hufflepuff next Saturday — HARRY! HERMIONE! WE DID IT! WE WON! Well, I mean, I’d already let in that one of Davies’s, so I wasn’t feeling that confident, but I dunno, when Bradley came toward me, just out of nowhere, I thought — you can do this! And I had about a second to decide which way to fly, you know, because he looked like he was aiming for the right goal hoop — my right, obviously, his left — but I had a funny feeling that he was feinting, and so I took the chance and flew left — his right, I mean — and — well — you saw what happened, And then, when Chambers came at me about five minutes later — what? Why are you grinning? Yeah, Well, yeah — more out of temper than anything, though . . . But you saw her chuck her broom away when she got back to the ground, didn’t you? You didn’t watch? You didn’t see me make any of those saves? Yeah? How come? He brought one back and hid it in the forest? No, No, he can’t have . . . He’s lost his mind, Well, you’re just going to have to break your promise, that’s all, I mean, come on . . . We’ve got exams and we’re about that far, from being chucked out as it is. And anyway . . . remember Norbert? Remember Aragog? Have we ever come off better for mixing with any of Hagrid’s monster mates? Well, Hagrid hasn’t been sacked yet, has he? He’s hung on this long, maybe he’ll hang on till the end of term and we won’t have to go near Grawp at all. Hermione, we wanted to buy that! Dingle’s got powdered dragon claw? Dragon claw does work! Well, we were always going to fail that one, Still, at least we can give it up now. And from now on, I don’t care if my tea leaves spell die, Ron, die — I’m just chucking them in the bin where they belong. Where have you been? G-get there? But — Harry . . . He’s got a point, Sirius might’ve cracked and just wanted some fresh air, You know what, I’ve just thought of something, Sirius’s brother was a Death Eater, wasn’t he? Maybe he told Sirius the secret of how to get the weapon! Hermione, Harry’s seen them! I never said I had a problem! I’ll do it, I’ll tell her Peeves is smashing up the Transfiguration department or something, it’s miles away from her office. Come to think of it, I could probably persuade Peeves to do it if I met him on the way . . . NO! Yeah, we were just wondering that, So, had any ideas? Couple of Stunners, a Disarming Charm, Neville brought off a really nice little Impediment Jinx, But Ginny was best, she got Malfoy — Bat-Bogey Hex — it was superb, his whole face was covered in the great flapping things. Anyway, we saw you heading into the forest out of the window and followed. What’ve you done with Umbridge? Hagrid’s little brother, Anyway, never mind that now. Harry, what did you find out in the fire? Has You-Know-Who got Sirius or — ? Yeah, but you’re not coming, Is it those mad horse things? Those ones you can’t see unless you’ve watched someone snuff it? How many? What makes you think that? How’re we supposed to get on? When we can’t see the things? This is mad, Mad . . . if I could just see it — Never again, Never, ever again . . . that was the worst — Let’s get on with it, What was that about? What? Where do we go, then, Harry? What’re those things? There are doors here too, I’m here, mate, This is it, then, isn’t it? Bound to be! But what if that’s the one? Harry? Have you seen this? It’s — it’s got your name on, What? What? What’s your name doing down here? I’m not here, None of the rest of us are here . . . Harry, There you are. . . . Ha ha ha . . . You look funny, Harry. . . . You’re all messed up . . . Harry, Get it, Harry? We saw Uranus — ha ha ha — Harry, you know who this girl is, Harry?  She’s Loony .. . Loony Lovegood . . . ha ha ha . . . Harry, Hey, Harry, there are brains in here, ha ha ha, isn’t that weird, Harry? Harry, Harry, Harry, He’s ‘the Boy Who Lived’ again now, though, isn’t he? Not such a show-off maniac anymore, eh? I think he left it as a monument to Fred and George, They sent me all these, you know, Must be doing all right out of that joke shop, eh? I s’pose Filch is happy, is he? Yeah, she shows signs of life if you do this, Bet Dumbledore wishes he could’ve got rid of Trelawney for good, Mind you, the whole subject’s useless if you ask me, Firenze isn’t a lot better . . . Yeah, it is, Still, at least You-Know-Who never found out what was in it either — where are you going? Oh all right then, Wish we could come . . . Just do it tomorrow! Come on, I’m starving . . . Goyle’s mum’ll be really pleased, though, He’s loads better-looking now. . . . Anyway, Harry, the food trolley’s just stopped if you want anything . . . Hey, Harry, What’s — er — going on with you and her anyway? You’re well out of it, mate, I mean, she’s quite good-looking and all that, but you want someone a bit more cheerful. Who’s she with now anyway? But you were going out with him! Well, I always thought he was a bit of an idiot, Good for you. Just choose someone — better — next time. Why? What are they supposed to be? We didn’t know you were here already! All right? Not bad, When did you get here? Mum’s only just told us! Were the Muggles all right? Did they treat you okay? Don’t worry about that, Mum’s bringing you up a tray; she reckons you look underfed, So, what’s been going on? Come off it! You’ve been off with Dumbledore! Oh, — we thought it’d be something like that. Yeah . . . yeah, now Umbridge has left, obviously we need a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, don’t we? So, er, what’s he like? What’s up with you? Can’t you two lay off her for five seconds? They’ve known each other a year, Well, you do, but if she jumps out at you unexpectedly, like then . . . Yeah, that’ll work, Listen, no bloke in his right mind’s going to fancy Tonks when Fleur’s around. I mean, Tonks is okay-looking when she isn’t doing stupid things to her hair and her nose, but — She hasn’t been much of a laugh lately, Every time I’ve seen her she’s looked more like Moaning Myrtle. That’s stupid, With her — ? Dunno, but if Fred and George’ve left it here, it’s probably not ready for the joke shop yet, so be careful. That’s an understatement, They’re raking in the Galleons! Nope, Sounds like the sort of mental thing Dumbledore would say, You kept that quiet! Blimey . . . private lessons with Dumbledore! I wonder why he’s . . . ? Although the Prophet says — Don’t worry, Mum’ll fix that, she’s good at healing minor injuries — When we heard Dumbledore was collecting you in person, we thought he might be telling you something or showing you something to do with the prophecy, And we were kind of right, weren’t we? He wouldn’t be giving you lessons if he thought you were a goner, wouldn’t waste his time — he must think you’ve got a chance! Can’t be long now, it’s been a month, Hermione, will you shut up, you’re not the only one who’s nervous! And when you’ve got your ten ‘Outstanding’ O. W.L.s . . . They’re definitely owls, Here you are — Knew you’d be top at Defense Against the Dark Arts, We’ve done all right, haven’t we? You did? Yep — nine ‘Outstandings’ and one ‘Exceeds Expectations’ at Defense Against the Dark Arts. You’re actually disappointed, aren’t you? Well, we’re N. E.W.T. students now! Mum, are there any more sausages? Why? Where’s mine? / Big surprise, / / / Listen! What was that about? No, he was behind that cabinet — What are you — ? Remember that shriveled-up arm Malfoy had? You reckon? Malfoy, revenge? What can he do about it? Your scar’s not hurting again, is it? Malfoy? He’s sixteen, Harry! You think You-Know-Who would let Malfoy join? Well . . . Yeah, I still don’t reckon You-Know-Who would let Malfoy join. . . . Wish the lunch trolley would hurry up, I’m starving, Hi, Neville.Hi, Luna.  Guess what? Malfoy’s not doing prefect duty. He’s just sitting in his compartment with the other Slytherins, we saw him when we passed. The usual, Not like him, though, is it? Well — that is but why isn’t he out there bullying first years? What is it? Where’ve you — blimey, what’ve you done to your face? “You’ve seen Snape? How come?” Yeah, That’s not saying much, seeing as you’re already dead, What do you mean? He might just go back to teaching Potions at the end of the year, That Slughorn bloke might not want to stay long-term. Moody didn’t. What really happened to your nose? I saw Malfoy miming something to do with a nose, Come on, Harry, he was just showing off for Parkinson. . . . What kind of mission would You-Know-Who have given him? But he was obviously showing off for Parkinson, wasn’t he? It’s rude to point, I love being a sixth year. And we’re going to be getting free time this year. Whole periods when we can just sit up here and relax. Yeah, but not today, Today’s going to be a real doss, I reckon. Excellent, I’ve always wanted one of these. Look, we’ve got a free period now . . . and a free period after break . . . and after lunch . . . excellent! That was brilliant, Harry! He enjoys Acid Pops? Well, what’s so impressive about that? You are the best in the year — I’d’ve told him so if he’d asked me! How are you doing that? Look, Could’ve been a catastrophe, couldn’t it? But he took a risk and it paid off. Slughorn could’ve handed me that book, but no, I get the one no one’s ever written on. Puked on, by the look of page fifty-two, but — Or herself, It might have been a girl. I think the handwriting looks more like a girl’s than a boy’s. Hope it goes okay, We’ve got Quidditch tryouts this morning! And we’re supposed to be practicing that Aguamenti Charm from Flitwick! Anyway, explain what? How are we going to tell him we hated his stupid subject? Speak for yourself, I haven’t forgotten the skrewts, And I’m telling you now, we’ve had a narrow escape. You didn’t hear him going on about his gormless brother — we’d have been teaching Grawp how to tie his shoelaces if we’d stayed. You can still see where those brains got hold of me in the Ministry, look, I’m tall, Come off it, you’ve ridden him, haven’t you? And they grow into . . . ? Yeah, I think we saw a bit of that side of them, I doubt you’ll be alone, Ginny’ll probably be invited, Oh, drop it, Harry, Well, as I’m not invited to any parties, I think I’ll go to bed. Aaaaaaaargh! Tomorrow, I’d rather you set the alarm clock. . . . and then there was another flash of light and I landed on the bed again! It was a laugh! Just a laugh, Hermione, that’s all! Fred and George, it’s their kind of thing. And, er — That was different, They were abusing it. Harry and his dad were just having a laugh. You don’t like the Prince, Hermione, There is no way they’d let me be a Death Eater! My whole family are blood traitors! That’s as bad as Muggle-borns to Death Eaters! Hang on, Nothing, And also, Loads of people go to Borgin and Burkes . . . and didn’t that girl say Katie got it in the girls’ bathroom? McGonagall! Well, he would look a bit of a prat carrying a necklace, And also, — that’s what I said — But — So who do you reckon Katie was supposed to give the necklace to? There’s no point arguing with him. It wasn’t a very slick attack, really, when you stop and think about it, The curse didn’t even make it into the castle. Not what you’d call foolproof. Wow, scary thought, the boy You-Know-Who, But I still don’t get why Dumbledore’s showing you all this. I mean, it’s really interesting and everything, but what’s the point? Gwenog Jones? The Gwenog Jones? Captain of the Holyhead Harpies? Okay, Professor, we’re starting now! should’ve used Muffliato, Harry. You know, I don’t think I’ll be having any of these in my garden when I’ve got my own place, And this is another party just for Slughorn’s favorites, is it? ‘Slug Club,’ It’s pathetic. Well, I hope you enjoy your party. Why don’t you try hooking up with McLaggen, then Slughorn can make you King and Queen Slug — You were going to ask me? No, I wouldn’t, Gotcha! It was an accident, I’m sorry, Demelza, really sorry! I played like a sack of dragon dung, Oi! I don’t want to find my own sister snogging people in public! Yeah, it is! Shut your mouth! You don’t know what you’re talking about! Just because I don’t do it in public — ! You — Oi, out of the way! D’you think Hermione did snog Krum? Dilligrout, You calling me mental? I know you haven’t got any time to find another Keeper, so I’ll play tomorrow, but if we lose, and we will, I’m taking myself off the team. Anything, What? Yeah, Lucky, I call it, And Vaisey off too, he’s their best goal scorer, I didn’t fancy — hey! I . . . you . . . My drink . . . my pumpkin juice . . . you didn’t . . . ? What are you going to do, turn us in? There really wasn’t anything in my pumpkin juice? But the weather’s good . . . and Vaisey couldn’t play. . . . I honestly haven’t been given lucky potion? You added Felix Felicis to Ron’s juice this morning, that’s why he saved everything! See! I can save goals without help, Hermione! Oh, Hi, Harry! Wondered where you’d got to! Gerremoffme! You could’ve taken anyone! Anyone! And you chose Loony Lovegood? She laughed at my mustache! So Snape was offering to help him? He was definitely offering to help him? I’m only checking! An Unbreakable Vow? Nah, he can’t have. . . . Are you sure? Well, you can’t break an Unbreakable Vow. . . . You die, Fred and George tried to get me to make one when I was about five. I nearly did too, I was holding hands with Fred and everything when Dad found us. He went mental, Only time I’ve ever seen Dad as angry as Mum. Fred reckons his left buttock has never been the same since. I’ll be seventeen in two and a bit months’ time, and then I’ll be able to do it by magic! You made me do that! You wait, when I’m seventeen — “Mind your own business. What d’you mean? What? What are you two up to? Can’t you help us with these sprouts? You could just use your wand and then we’ll be free too! Gits, Would’ve only taken them ten seconds and then we could’ve gone too. Oh yeah, Are you going to tell Dumbledore what you heard Snape and Malfoy saying to each other? Pity you didn’t hear what Malfoy’s actually doing, though. ’Course, you know what they’ll all say? Dad and Dumbledore and all of them? They’ll say Snape isn’t really trying to help Malfoy, he was just trying to find out what Malfoy’s up to. Yeah . . . I’m just saying, though, Yeah, I do! Seriously, I do! But they’re all convinced Snape’s in the Order, aren’t they? She’s got to be joking. . . . It’s from Lavender, She can’t honestly think I’d wear . . . If you tell them, How could she think I’d like something like that, though? Well . . . we don’t really talk much, It’s mainly . . . Well, yeah, Is Hermione really going out with McLaggen? Can’t be anything dangerous, all our mail’s still being searched at the Ministry, Hermione would. But let’s wait and see what it is before you start feeling guilty. Nice, Very thoughtful. Yes, isn’t it? Gravy, Fleur? Yeah, don’t worry about us, or about Percy. He’s such a prat, it’s not really a loss, is it? Baubles, What d’you mean, ‘no’? But we’ve been away, how’re we supposed to — ? Yeah, pretty eventful, Rufus Scrim — So — Apparition, Should be a laugh, eh? Yeah, but Charlie’s bigger than me so Fred and George didn’t go on about it much . . . not to his face anyway . . . Soon as we’re seventeen. That’s only March for me! Not the point, is it? Everyone would know I could Apparate if I wanted. Dum — er — someone took him. Side-Along-Apparition, you know. He loves you, Won’t refuse you anything, will he? Not his little Potions Prince. Just hang back after class this afternoon and ask him. What’ve you done? You sure the Prince hasn’t got any tips? How did you do? I think I felt something the last time I tried — a kind of tingling in my feet. What d’you mean, you don’t care? Don’t you want to learn to Apparate? Are you going to tell me what we’re doing, then? Harry . . . There! He’s in the Slytherin common room, look . . . with Parkinson and Zabini and Crabbe and Goyle . . . It was on my birthday! I was looking forward to that! But now all I’ve got to look forward to is stupid Apparition! Cheers, Nice one, Harry! Seriously good haul this year! See what Mum and Dad got me? Blimey, I think I’ll come of age next year too. . . . Want one? Can’t have done, Come on, if you don’t hurry up, you’ll have to Apparate on an empty stomach. . . . Might make it easier, I suppose . . . I’m not hungry. Well, all right, I’ll come down with you, but I don’t want to eat. It’s not that, You . . . you wouldn’t understand. Harry Harry, I can’t stand it! I can’t stop thinking about her! I don’t think she knows I exist, “Who are you talking about?” Who are you talking about? Romilda Vane, I think . . . Harry, I think I love her, I love her, Have you seen her hair, it’s all black and shiny and silky . . . and her eyes? Her big dark eyes? And her — Harry! You said it was a joke! They were a birthday present! I offered you one, didn’t I? Let me go! Romilda? he repeated. Did you say Romilda? Harry — do you know her? Can you introduce me? Why will she be in there? Maybe I could ask if I can have them with her? Leave me alone, Harry’s going to introduce me to Romilda Vane. I can’t see her, Harry — is he hiding her? She didn’t see that, did she? Okay, How do I look? Brilliant, Er-my-nee, So how’s McLaggen shaping up? Oh, Yeah. All right. . . Oh, Right. Well, good luck. Hope you hammer McLag — I mean, Smith. Nice of you to drop in, Well, yeah I do, Final score was three hundred and twenty to sixty. You don’t want to get hold of him, he’s the size of a troll, Personally, I think there’s a lot to be said for hexing him with that toenail thing of the Prince’s. Anyway, the rest of the team might’ve dealt with him before you get out of here, they’re not happy. . . . I could hear the match commentary from here, I hope Luna always commentates from now on. . . . Loser’s Lurgy . . . Ginny came in to visit while you were unconscious, She reckons you only just arrived on time for the match. How come? You left here early enough. Don’t be stupid, You couldn’t have missed a Quidditch match just to follow Malfoy, you’re the Captain! . . but there’s no rule saying only one person at a time can be plotting anything in this place! You’re getting a bit obsessed with Malfoy, Harry. I mean, thinking about missing a match just to follow him . . . . . Well then, I dunno, said Ron. What’s going — ? Nice one, That was another Prince hex, wasn’t it? At least you can Apparate, though! You’ll have no trouble come July! How d’you spell ‘belligerent’? It’s one of Fred and George’s Spell-Check ones . . . but I think the charm must be wearing off. . . . Don’t say I’ll have to write the whole thing out again! I love you, Hermione, I won’t, Or maybe I will . . . then she’ll ditch me . . . You haven’t ever chucked anyone, have you? Wish that would happen with me and Lavender, But the more I hint I want to finish it, the tighter she holds on. It’s like going out with the giant squid. Thanks a million, Can I borrow your quill for the conclusion? Maybe the Marauders never knew the room was there, Yeah, it’s great, Nicked what? He’s got Crabbe and Goyle transforming into girls? Blimey . . . No wonder they don’t look too happy these days. . . . I’m surprised they don’t tell him to stuff it. . . . Wish I could Disapparate like a house-elf, I’d have that Apparition Test in the bag. Anyone we know — ? Well, what Harry said is the most useful if we’re trying to tell them apart! Snape’s right, though, isn’t he? I dunno whether it’s worth me taking the test. I just can’t get the hang of Apparition. Who were you expecting? When you say you had lots in common, d’you mean he lives in an S-bend too? — not the grave, surely? The sewers, maybe . . . You’re right, I’ll do the practice sessions in Hogsmeade before I decide about taking the test. I did it — well, kind of! I was supposed to be Apparating to outside Madam Puddifoot’s Tea Shop and I overshot it a bit, ended up near Scrivenshaft’s, but at least I moved! Oh,  I’ll be surprised if he doesn’t pop the question soon Goes back to what I said, doesn’t it? She’s gone a bit funny. Lost her nerve. Women, they’re easily upset. Oh, good, Hagrid That thing told its mates to eat Harry and me! Told them to help themselves! And now Hagrid expects us to go down there and cry over its horrible hairy body! Hagrid You didn’t meet him, Hermione. Believe me, being dead will have improved him a lot. Lucky, Harry, that’s it — get lucky! Use your lucky potion! What for? Oh, stop that, I feel sick enough as it is — quick, hide me! Cool, Blimey, they don’t look happy, do they? I’m losing track of what’s happening to everyone’s relatives, to be honest, They sometimes kill, I’ve heard of it happening when the werewolf gets carried away. Yeah, I s’pose, But half an eyebrow! Like that matters! So, Harry — you going to use the Felix Felicis or what? It’s a great feeling when you take it, Like you can’t do anything wrong. Yeah, but I thought I had, didn’t I? Same difference really . . . Wow, Wow. You’re actually going to go with Dumbledore . . . and try and destroy . . . wow. Oh yeah, Sorry . . . looks like we’ve all got horrible dandruff now. . . . We split up, Last night. When she saw me coming out of the dormitory with Hermione. Obviously she couldn’t see you, so she thought it had just been the two of us. No, It was pretty bad while she was yelling, but at least I didn’t have to finish it. Flitwick, Couldn’t we make some more? It’d be great to have a stock of it. . . . Have a look in the book . . . Typical, Where’ve you — ? Why are you soaking — ? Is that blood? But what about the Half-Blood — Leave it, Hermione, We won! We won! Four hundred and fifty to a hundred and forty! We won! Yeah, I would, She’s just never got over you outperforming her in Potions, ’Course not, He was a genius, the Prince. Anyway . . . without his bezoar tip . . . I wouldn’t be here to discuss it, would I? I mean, I’m not saying that spell you used on Malfoy was great — But he healed all right, didn’t he? Back on his feet in no time. You still got detention with Snape this Saturday? Blimey, You don’t reckon . . . he hasn’t found . . . ? Thanks, Er — why do I need socks? But he wasn’t bitten at the full moon, Greyback hadn’t transformed, so surely Bill won’t be a — a real — ? Dumbledore might know something that’d work, though, Where is he? Bill fought those maniacs on Dumbledore’s orders, Dumbledore owes him, he can’t leave him in this state — I messed up, Harry, We did like you told us: We checked the Marauder’s Map and we couldn’t see Malfoy on it, so we thought he must be in the Room of Requirement, so me, Ginny, and Neville went to keep watch on it . . . but Malfoy got past us. His Hand of Glory, Gives light only to the holder, remember? — Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder, Fred and George’s. I’m going to be having a word with them about who they let buy their products. None of us could break through, and that massive Death Eater was still firing off jinxes all over the place, they were bouncing off the walls and barely missing us. . . . Lupin said they would, So? Did you find one? Did you get it? A — a Horcrux? You didn’t get it? It wasn’t there? “Already taken — ?” R.A.B., but who was that? Anyone else we know died? I thought she wasn’t much of a looker, I still don’t get why he didn’t turn you in for using that book, He must’ve known where you were getting it all from. But why didn’t he turn you in? None of us could’ve guessed Snape would . . . you know, — because it’s the first time for all of us, Harry glanced at Ron, who grimaced at him in a just-do-it sort of way. I knew Ginny was lying about that tattoo, Well, you can’t do anything about thetill you’re seventeen. You’ve still got the Trace on you. And we can plan here as well as anywhere, can’t we? Or, d’you reckon you already know where the You-Know-Whats are? I think Hermione’s been doing a bit of research, She said she was saving it for when you got here. Five days, We’ve got to stay for the wedding. They’ll kill us if we miss it. It’s one extra day, No, They haven’t got a clue. And now you mention it, I wanted to talk to you about that. Mum’s been trying to get it out of Hermione and me. What we’re off to do. She’ll try you next, so brace yourself. Dad and Lupin’ve both asked as well, but when we said Dumbledore told you not to tell anyone except us, they dropped it. Not Mum, though. She’s determined. Isn’t anyone at the Ministry prepared to stand up to him? I’m doing it, I’m doing — ! Oh, it’s you, We were just talking about Mad-Eye, I reckon he might have survived. Yeah, but Bill was under attack too, How can he be sure what he saw? He could have used a Shield Charm — Well, all right, if you want him to be dead, The Death Eaters probably tidied up after themselves, that’s why no one’s found him, Tergeo. Yeah, But you know what he’d say to us if he was here? That’s right, He’d tell us to learn from what happened to him. And what I’ve learned is not to trust that cowardly little squit, Mundungus. What are you doing with all those books anyway? Oh, of course, I forgot we’ll be hunting down Voldemort in a mobile library. Here he goes, Shut up, Nah, he’s just eaten, Oh, all right. Harry, come here. C’mon. Descendo, That’s right, Come and have a look at him. No, Nor have they usually got red hair or that number of pustules. He’s me, see? I’ll explain it back in my room, the smell’s getting to me, Once we’ve left, the ghoul’s going to come and live down here in my room, I think he’s really looking forward to it — well, it’s hard to tell, because all he can do is moan and drool — but he nods a lot when you mention it. Anyway, he’s going to be me with spattergroit. Good, eh? It is! Look, when we three don’t turn up at Hogwarts again, everyone’s going to think Hermione and I must be with you, right? Which means the Death Eaters will go straight for our families to see if they’ve got information on where you are. We can’t hide my whole family, it’ll look too fishy and they can’t all leave their jobs, So we’re going to put out the story that I’m seriously ill with spattergroit, which is why I can’t go back to school. If anyone comes calling to investigate, Mum or Dad can show them the ghoul in my bed, covered in pustules. Spattergroit’s really contagious, so they’re not going to want to go near him. It won’t matter that he can’t say anything, either, because apparently you can’t once the fungus has spread to your uvula. Mum . . . well, you’ve seen what she’s like. She won’t accept we’re going till we’ve gone. Ginny’s probably left a speck of dust on a poxy napkin ring, I dunno why the Delacours have got to come two days before the wedding. Well, guests aren’t going to help Mum’s stress levels, This R.A.B. person, You know, the one who stole the real locket? He said in his note he was going to destroy it, didn’t he? Yeah, Whichever, it’d be one less for us to do! And once we get hold of it, how do you destroy a Horcrux? How in the name of Merlin’s pants have you managed to get your hands on those Horcrux books? Get to the point! Can you hear us complaining? Where are these books anyway? Why did he have to ask Slughorn how to make a Horcrux, then, if he’d already read that? Isn’t there any way of putting yourself back together? That’s right, So does it say how to destroy Horcruxes in that book? Oh well, lucky we’ve got such a large supply of basilisk fangs, then, I was wondering what we were going to do with them. But even if we wreck the thing it lives in, why can’t the bit of soul in it just go and live in something else? Which would be a real comfort to me, I’m sure, Hang on, The bit of soul in that diary was possessing Ginny, wasn’t it? How does that work, then? It’s like being a house-elf, Except without the job satisfaction. The sooner this wedding’s over, the happier I’ll be. But she still won’t leave us alone! Oi, wake up. You were muttering in your sleep. ’ You kept saying ‘Gregorovitch. ’ I dunno, do I? You were the one saying it. Poor bloke, Who? You reckon you were seeing into his mind again? Quidditch? Sure you’re not thinking of Gorgovitch? Dragomir Gorgovitch, Chaser, transferred to the Chudley Cannons for a record fee two years ago. Record holder for most Quaffle drops in a season. I try not to either, Well, happy birthday anyway. Slick, I’d do your fly by hand, though, Here’s your present. Unwrap it up here, it’s not for my mother’s eyes. This isn’t your average book, It’s pure gold: Twelve Fail-Safe Ways to Charm Witches. Explains everything you need to know about girls. If only I’d had this last year I’d have known exactly how to get rid of Lavender and I would’ve known how to get going with . . . Well, Fred and George gave me a copy, and I’ve learned a lot. You’d be surprised, it’s not all about wandwork, either. Oh, Sorry. You ditched her. What are you doing now, messing her around? She was really cut up when you ended it — Yeah, but you go snogging her now and she’s just going to get her hopes up again — If you keep groping her every chance you get — Right then, well, that’s . . . yeah. Us? Why us? A-all of us? Me and Hermione too? Me? Not — not really . . . It was always Harry who . . . I . . . dunno, I . . . when I say we weren’t close . . . I mean, I think he liked me. . . . Put out lights, I s’pose, What else could I do with it? Oi! Thought you didn’t approve of that spell? Still, it’s cool, And from what they said, Dumbledore invented it himself! D’you think he knew the Ministry would confiscate his will and examine everything he’d left us? asked Harry. Right? Was I? I always said he was mental. Brilliant and everything, but cracked. Leaving Harry an old Snitch — what the hell was that about? That was the one you nearly swallowed! And the sword, Why did he want Harry to have the sword? You’ve never heard of The Tales of Beedle the Bard? You’re kidding, right? Was I? All the old kids’ stories are supposed to be Beedle’s, aren’t they?  ‘The Fountain of Fair Fortune’ ...  ‘Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump’ . . . Come off it! What’s that, an illness? Yeah, I mean, that’s just what you hear, you know, that all these old stories came from Beedle. I dunno what they’re like in the original versions. Probably just Charlie, now Mum’s asleep, sneaking off to regrow his hair, No, A brutal triple murder by the bridegroom’s mother might put a bit of a damper on the wedding. I’ll get the lights. Yes, Isn’t she with you? Ours do know a lot of excellent swear words, but I think Fred and George taught them those. How come you’re here? Did you see he’s grown a stupid little beard? Where are we? Hermione, we haven’t got anything to change into, You’re amazing, you are, She’s right, Most of the Order was there, they’ll look after everyone. That’s Dolohov, I recognize him from the old wanted posters. I think the big one’s Thorfinn Rowle. What are we going to do with them? Kill them? They’d kill us. They had a good go just now. You’re the boss, But I’ve never done a Memory Charm. Clear up? Why? Oh right, yeah . . . It’s no wonder I can’t get it out, Hermione, you packed my old jeans, they’re tight. He can’t have, The Trace breaks at seventeen, that’s Wizarding law, you can’t put it on an adult. Don’t be silly, Harry, Snape can get in there! That could’ve happened as the Order left, Maybe they’re only activated if he shows up? It’s all r-right. . . . It’s g-gone. . . . Well, you’ve just had a big shock, What was that supposed to do? And old Dusty, But — And you’d think, if Harry still had a Trace on him, they’d have followed us here. I know they can’t get in the house, but — what’s up, Harry? What did you see? Did you see him at my place? But that could be at the Burrow, What else? Didn’t you see anything? Was he cursing someone? Harry, What’s up? If it’s massive spiders again I want breakfast before I — What? That was Sirius’s brother, wasn’t it?   Regulus Arcturus . . . Regulus . The locket — you don’t reckon — ? Is that it, then? It’s not here? How are we supposed to find it then? That’s a good idea, Something wrong? Harry? He Disapparated! Elf magic isn’t like wizard’s magic, is it? I mean, they can Apparate and Disapparate in and out of Hogwarts when we can’t. Overkill, mate, Death Eaters, for sure, Reckon they know we’re in here? D’you reckon he’s been in here and had his tongue tied by Moody’s curse? Sorry, sorry! I don’t know I’m doing it! — and he left me the Deluminator, maybe I’m supposed to use it! Why didn’t Voldemort declare himself Minister of Magic? People won’t let this happen,  What if purebloods and half-bloods swear a Muggle-born’s part of their family? I’ll tell everyone Hermione’s my cousin — You won’t have a choice, I’ll teach you my family tree so you can answer questions on it. Excellent! said Ron enthusiastically. Don’t you start on her! snarled Ron. You shouldn’t have said that stuff to Lupin, No, you shouldn’t, No, he hasn’t, He’s wondering whether he should have asked more money for it. What do you mean? What’s happened? She must be upset. The other teachers won’t stand for this. McGonagall and Flitwick and Sprout all know the truth, they know how Dumbledore died. They won’t accept Snape as headmaster. And who are these Carrows? I’ve been thinking about that all day. It left nearly six hours ago. Weird, not being on it, isn’t it? I do that every time. Oh, here she is, And what in the name of Merlin’s most baggy Y Fronts was that about? Sorry? What d’you think I was doing? Good thinking! Dad always told us most Ministry people use the Floo Network to get to work, That’s why we haven’t seen Umbridge, she’d never walk, she’d think she’s too important. Oh yeah, the bloke from Magical Maintenance, Dad said everyone from Magical Maintenance wears navy blue robes. Well, does it really matter? Blimey, Hermione, I forget one little thing — Unless, she’s found a way of opening it and she’s now possessed. All right, let’s say we go for it tomorrow. . . . I think it should just be me and Harry. It’s one thing hanging around the entrances under the Cloak, but this is different, Hermione. You’re on the list of Muggle-borns who didn’t present themselves for interrogation! Well, if all three of us go we’ll have to Disapparate separately, We can’t all fit under the Cloak anymore. You look terrible, Nicely done, Hermione, She’s Mafalda Hopkirk, You’d better take this, Hermione, and here are the tokens. Yeah, stupid, isn’t it? We have to flush ourselves in? Raining . . . in your office? That’s — that’s not good, is it? I — I — stammered Ron. Yes, What am I going to do? If I don’t turn up, my wife — I mean, Cattermole’s wife — That’s mental, we haven’t got much time. You two find Umbridge, I’ll go and sort out Yaxley’s office — but how do I stop it raining? Say it again, slowly — M-morning, Harry! Blimey, I forgot what you looked like — why isn’t Hermione with you? Harry, Let go, I’m not your husband, you’ve got to go home! Lousy, Where are we? D’you reckon we should move on? Where are you going? Don’t say the name! I’m sorry, but it feels like a — a jinx or something. Can’t we call him You-Know-Who — please? In case you hadn’t noticed, mate, calling You-Know-Who by his name didn’t do Dumbledore much good in the end, Just — just show You-Know-Who some respect, will you? You got it? No one tells me anything! Blimey, you could have mentioned it! I mean I mean, are we sure it’s still a Horcrux? Can you feel it, though? I think we should take it in turns to keep watch outside the tent, And we’ll need to think about some food as well. You stay there, Don’t say his name! What’s You-Know-Who doing? How’s Gregorovitch supposed to make him a new wand if he’s tied up? Couldn’t you see what the thief was holding? Harry? Harry, you don’t reckon You-Know-Who’s after something else to turn into a Horcrux? Yeah, but maybe he doesn’t know that. But you can make a brilliant Patronus! So we still haven’t got any food. What? I’m starving! All I’ve had since I bled half to death is a couple of toadstools! I would, but my arm’s in a sling, in case you hadn’t noticed! And what’s that supposed to — ? Great, and now we’ve sorted that out, can we please get some food? ’Er-my-nee, ’oo worry ’oo much. ’Elax! So where next? Yeah, let’s go to Albania. Shouldn’t take more than an afternoon to search an entire country, Didn’t I ask you to stop saying that? Not particularly. Oi! Oh, come on, His school? This is You-Know-Who we’re talking about, right? Not you? What? What did you see? My mother, can make good food appear out of thin air. Oh, speak English, can’t you? Well, don’t bother increasing this, it’s disgusting, No, it’s because you’re supposed to be the best at magic! Shut up about my sister, Oh, remembered me, have you? Ah, Problem? There’s no problem, Not according to you, anyway. All right, I’ll spit it out. Don’t expect me to skip up and down the tent because there’s some other damn thing we’ve got to find. Just add it to the list of stuff you don’t know. It’s not like I’m not having the time of my life here, you know, with my arm mangled and nothing to eat and freezing my backside off every night. I just hoped, you know, after we’d been running round a few weeks, we’d have achieved something. Ah, We thought you knew what you were doing! We thought Dumbledore had told you what to do, we thought you had a real plan! Ah, Don’t lie! You said it too, you said you were disappointed, you said you’d thought he had a bit more to go on than — I don’t know. Ah, Didn’t you hear what they said about my sister? But you don’t give a rat’s fart, do you, it’s only the Forbidden Forest, Harry I’ve-Faced-Worse Potter doesn’t care what happens to her in here — well, I do, all right, giant spiders and mental stuff — Ah, And what about the rest of my family, ‘the Weasleys don’t need another kid injured,’ did you hear that? Not bothered what it meant, though? Yeah, Right then, well, I won’t bother myself about them. It’s all right for you two, isn’t it, with your parents safely out of the way — And mine could be going the same way! What? Are you staying, or what? I see, Are — you — mental? Why the hell, didn’t you take this thing off before you dived? Well, yeah, What? No, of course not! Oh yeah. I thought it looked different. No antlers. Well, I’ve — you know — I’ve come back. If — You know. You still want me. Oh yeah, I got it out, That’s why you jumped in, right? Long story, I’ve been looking for you for hours, it’s a big forest, isn’t it? And I was just thinking I’d have to kip under a tree and wait for morning when I saw that deer coming and you following. No, I did think I saw something move over there, but I was running to the pool at the time, because you’d gone in and you hadn’t come up, so I wasn’t going to make a detour to — hey! Anything there? So how did the sword get in that pool? You reckon this is the real one? What? Why? How are you going to open it? No! No, don’t open it! I’m serious! I can’t, Harry, I’m serious — you do it — Because that thing’s bad for me! I can’t handle it! Tell me when, I’m sorry, I’m sorry I left. I know I was a — a — That makes me sound a lot cooler than I was, Ouch — ow — gerroff! What the — ? Hermione — OW! I’m sorry, Hermione, I’m sorry, I’m really — What? Yeah, Harry’s all over the Prophet, all over the radio, they’re looking for you everywhere, all these rumors and mental stories, I knew I’d hear straight off if you were dead, you don’t know what it’s been like — Hermione, Yeah, I was on my own and I look like I might be school age; they got really excited, thought I was a Muggle-born in hiding. I had to talk fast to get out of being dragged to the Ministry. Told them I was Stan Shunpike. First person I could think of. They weren’t the brightest. One of them was definitely part troll, the smell off him. . . . Anyway, they had a row about whether I was Stan or not.It was a bit pathetic to be honest but there were still five of them and only one of me and they’d taken my wand. Then two of them got into a fight and while the others were distracted I managed to hit the one holding me in the stomach, grabbed his wand, Disarmed the bloke holding mine, and Disapparated. I didn’t do it so well, Splinched myself again and I came out miles from where you were. By the time I got back to that bit of riverbank where we’d been . . . you’d gone. What? What are you, compared with the Boy Who Lived? This. It doesn’t just turn the lights on and off, I don’t know how it works or why it happened then and not any other time, because I’ve been wanting to come back ever since I left. But I was listening to the radio really early on Christmas morning and I heard . . . I heard you. No, I heard you coming out of my pocket. Your voice, came out of this. My name. ‘Ron. ’  And you said .. . something about a wand. . . . Your voice, and it didn’t seem different or anything, but I was sure I’d heard you. So I clicked it. And the light went out in my room, but another light appeared right outside the window. It was a ball of light, kind of pulsing, and bluish, like that light you get around a Portkey, you know? I knew this was it, I grabbed my stuff and packed it, then I put on my rucksack and went out into the garden. The little ball of light was hovering there, waiting for me, and when I came out it bobbed along a bit and I followed it behind the shed and then it . . . well, it went inside me. It sort of floated toward me, right to my chest, and then — it just went straight through. It was here, I could feel it, it was hot. And once it was inside me I knew what I was supposed to do, I knew it would take me where I needed to go. So I Disapparated and came out on the side of a hill. There was snow everywhere. . . . Yeah, well, that would’ve been me, Your protective spells work, anyway, because I couldn’t see you and I couldn’t hear you. I was sure you were around, though, so in the end I got in my sleeping bag and waited for one of you to appear. I thought you’d have to show yourselves when you packed up the tent. I stayed on that hill all day I kept hoping you’d appear. But when it started to get dark I knew I must have missed you, so I clicked the Deluminator again, the blue light came out and went inside me, and I Disapparated and arrived here in these woods. I still couldn’t see you, so I just had to hope one of you would show yourselves in the end — and Harry did. Well, I saw the doe first, obviously. What? Oh — oh yeah. You’re kidding? Yeah, Could’ve been worse. Remember those birds she set on me? Someone helped us, Someone sent that doe. Someone’s on our side. One Horcrux down, mate! . . . and how did you find out about the Taboo? You and Hermione have stopped saying You-Know-Who’s name! NO! Sorry, but the name’s been jinxed, Harry, that’s how they track people! Using his name breaks protective enchantments, it causes some kind of magical disturbance — it’s how they found us in Tottenham Court Road! Exactly! You’ve got to give them credit, it makes sense. It was only people who were serious about standing up to him, like Dumbledore, who ever dared use it. Now they’ve put a Taboo on it, anyone who says it is trackable — quick-and-easy way to find Order members! They nearly got Kingsley — Yeah, a bunch of Death Eaters cornered him, Bill said, but he fought his way out. He’s on the run now, just like us. You don’t reckon Kingsley could have sent that doe? Oh yeah . . . Harry . . . you don’t reckon it could’ve been Dumbledore? Dumbledore . . . the doe? I mean, he had the real sword last, didn’t he? Patronuses can change, though, can’t they? Tonks’s changed, didn’t it? Search me, Same reason he didn’t give it to you while he was alive? Same reason he left you an old Snitch and Hermione a book of kids’ stories? I dunno, I dunno Sometimes I’ve thought, when I’ve been a bit hacked off, he was having a laugh or — or he just wanted to make it more difficult. But I don’t think so, not anymore. He knew what he was doing when he gave me the Deluminator, didn’t he? He — well, he must’ve known I’d run out on you. Oh yeah, people are talking about it quite a lot. I don’t know that it’s such a big deal, though. He was really young when they — Our age, Stop that, I’m sorry I said Dumbledore was young, okay? There’s this one program, that tells the news like it really is. All the others are on You-Know-Who’s side and are following the Ministry line, but this one .. . you wait till you hear it, it’s great. Only they can’t do it every night, they have to keep changing locations in case they’re raided, and you need a password to tune in. . . . Trouble is, I missed the last one. . . . If it’s annoying you, I’ll stop! What? Er — what are you — ? The Deluminator turned out to be pretty useful, I think Hermione’s right, I think we ought to go and see Lovegood. It won’t be like Godric’s Hollow, Yeah, that makes sense. I think we should vote on it, Outvoted, Harry, sorry, Yeah, they’re not far from my place, I dunno exactly where, but Mum and Dad always point toward the hills whenever they mention them. Shouldn’t be hard to find. All’s fair in love and war, and this is a bit of both. Cheer up, it’s the Christmas holidays, Luna’ll be home! How d’you know it’s an Erumpent horn? Aren’t you the one who keeps telling everyone it’s their first duty to help Harry? In that magazine of yours? That’s for everyone else to do, not you personally? Cowardly old wart, Luna’s got ten times his guts. Fetching, Surprised he didn’t wear that to the wedding. Midnight, our mum always told us, I’m sorry, I’m sorry, Sometimes he gets bored of running at them, flapping his arms and shrieking . . . sorry, Hermione. When you say ‘master of Death’ — said Ron. Perhaps you ought to try on the hat, Hermione, So where do you think the Elder Wand is now? Who are the Peverells? Of what? No deal, Get out of the way, we’re leaving. Me? But Harry — That treacherous old bleeder! Hermione, you’re a genius, a total genius, I can’t believe we got out of that! Serves him right, What d’you reckon they’ll do to him? Why hide me, though? But what about your mum and dad? You’re a genius, Well, if they’re telling the truth and she’s still alive — Then she’ll be in Azkaban, I expect, Whether she survives the place, though . . . Loads don’t. . . . — if he hadn’t just tried to sell us to the Death Eaters, yeah, I don’t think so, It’s a damn sight harder making stuff up when you’re under stress than you’d think. I found that out when the Snatchers caught me. It was much easier pretending to be Stan, because I knew a bit about him, than inventing a whole new person. Old Lovegood was under loads of pressure, trying to make sure we stayed put. I reckon he told us the truth, or what he thinks is the truth, just to keep us talking. Hang on, though, The Chamber of Secrets was supposed to be a myth, wasn’t it? You keep saying that, but one of them can, ‘Extinct in the male line’? Blimey . . . You reckon it was this sign again? The sign of the Hallows? Blimey — but would it still work if Dumbledore broke — ? Work? Where d’you reckon the ring is now? What did Dumbledore do with it after he broke it open? You — you reckon? Harry, But when you look at the whole thing . . . I think we’re supposed to get rid of Horcruxes, Harry. That’s what Dumbledore told us to do. Maybe . . . maybe we should forget about this Hallows business. Three Horcruxes left, We need a plan of action, come on!  Where haven’t we looked? Let’s go through it again.The orphanage . . . You never know, Upper Flagley is a Wizarding village, he might’ve wanted to live there. Let’s go and have a poke around. Some of them are supposed to be as bad as Death Eaters, The lot that got me were a bit pathetic, but Bill reckons some of them are really dangerous. They said on Potterwatch — Potterwatch, didn’t I tell you that’s what it was called? The program I keep trying to get on the radio, the only one that tells the truth about what’s going on! Nearly all the programs are following You-Know-Who’s line, all except Potterwatch. I really want you to hear it, but it’s tricky tuning in. . . . They’re normally something to do with the Order, Bill had a real knack for guessing them. I’m bound to get one in the end. . . . I’ve got it, I’ve got it! Password was ‘Albus’! Get in here, Harry! ‘River,’ that’s Lee, They’ve all got code names, but you can usually tell — Kingsley! Oh, didn’t I tell you? Bill told me Lupin’s living with Tonks again! And apparently she’s getting pretty big too. . . . At least he’s still alive! It’s Fred, I think, Good, eh? Well, they keep on the move, don’t they? Like us. Harry, I told you, Harry, I told you, we can’t say it anymore — we’ve got to put the protection back around us — quickly — it’s how they find — Get — off — her! Stan Shunpike, I’b Bardy, Bardy Weadley. We’b lebt, Nod a laugh, Aggiden. Doh. No, HERMIONE! HERMIONE! HERMIONE! HERMIONE! HERMIONE! HERMIONE! HERMIONE! HERMIONE! HERMIONE! HERMIONE! HERMIONE! HERMIONE! HERMIONE! HERMIONE! HERMIONE! My pocket! In my pocket, there’s a Deluminator, and it’s full of light! HERMIONE! HERMIONE! HERMIONE! HERMIONE! HERMIONE! DOB — ! Bill and Fleur’s, Shell Cottage on the outskirts of Tinworth! Nothing! All fine! And we’ll have that, No! Relashio! No — Expelliarmus! Better, Fleur’s looking after her. Yeah . . . thanks, Dobby. What are we doing now, Harry? No, it isn’t, It’s been done. Well, goblins can do magic without wands, Well, goblins won’t share any of their magic either, You won’t tell us how to make swords and armor the way you do. Goblins know how to work metal in a way wizards have never — Don’t call yourself — Ron muttered. But — Ron started angrily; Hermione nudged him in the ribs. Little git, He’s enjoying keeping us hanging. But I thought we were looking for places You-Know-Who’s been, places he’s done something important? Was he ever inside the Lestranges’ vault? You really understand him. So I should use this one? Ron gave Harry a reproachful look, and said, Let’s not worry about that now — Dumbledore had the Elder Wand? But then — where is it now? Harry, Harry, let’s go and get it before he does! Harry! How long have you known this — why have we been wasting time? Why did you talk to Griphook first? We could have gone — we could still go — Harry! We can give you something else, I’ll bet the Lestranges have got loads of stuff, you can take your pick once we get into the vault. The sword’s ours — We’re Gryffindors, and it was Godric Gryffindor’s — No one’s, It was made for him, wasn’t it? He’s having a laugh. We can’t let him have that sword. It’ll be one of those goblin stories, about how the wizards are always trying to get one over on them. I suppose we should think ourselves lucky he hasn’t asked for one of our wands. Goblins aren’t exactly fluffy little bunnies, though, are they? They’ve killed plenty of us. They’ve fought dirty too. Okay, how’s this? We tell Griphook we need the sword until we get inside the vault, and then he can have it. There’s a fake in there, isn’t there? We switch them, and give him the fake. Yeah, but we could scarper before he realizes — All right, all right! It was the only thing I could think of! What’s your solution, then? Well, I think it’s genius, Let’s go and tell him. Blimey, a baby! It’ll probably help you get in character, though, Think what that wand’s done! He could give my mother lessons, Right, but remember, I don’t like the beard too long — It’s not that, it gets in the way! But I liked my nose a bit shorter, try and do it the way you did last time. What do we do? Shall we get out now, while we can? How are we going to get out again? Ron asked as they hurried on foot into the darkness after the goblin, Bogrod panting in their wake like an old dog. And how the hell are we going to get up there without touching anything? What do you reckon it’s looking for? Is it my imagination, or are we losing height? Well, on the upside, we got the Horcrux. On the downside — No sword, That double-crossing little scab . . . At least we can’t wear it this time, that’d look a bit weird hanging round our necks, You sound like Hagrid, It’s a dragon, Hermione, it can look after itself. It’s us we need to worry about. Well, I don’t know how to break this to you, but I think they might have noticed we broke into Gringotts. Maybe they’ll be too scared to tell him? How quickly would they realize what had been taken? But what did you see? How do you know? Did you see where in Hogwarts it is? Great idea, The silver doe! Was that you too? Someone sent a doe Patronus to us! Oh, Yeah . . . well, I’m hungry! How long’s this been here? It isn’t on the Marauder’s Map, is it, Harry? I thought there were only seven passages in and out of school? Released it into the wild, Blimey, Neville, there’s a time and a place for getting a smart mouth. But they’ve used you as a knife sharpener, No kidding, Cool, But, aren’t — aren’t we heading straight back into Hogwarts? Yeah, It hasn’t exactly been a picnic, mate, No! What we’re doing will benefit everyone in the end, it’s all about trying to get rid of You-Know-Who — Why can’t they help? They can help. We don’t know where it is. We’ve got to find it fast. We don’t have to tell them it’s a Horcrux. Sorry, but what is a diadem? Chamber of Secrets, Something to get rid of Horcruxes, It’s what you did to open the locket, I had to have a few goes to get it right, but, we got there in the end. So we’re another Horcrux down, Hermione stabbed it. Thought she should. She hasn’t had the pleasure yet. It was nothing, So what’s new with you? WAIT! We’ve forgotten someone! The house-elves, they’ll all be down in the kitchen, won’t they? No, I mean we should tell them to get out. We don’t want any more Dobbies, do we? We can’t order them to die for us — I know, mate, so it’s now or never, isn’t it? Yeah — right — sorry — said Ron, and he and Hermione set about gathering up fangs, both pink in the face. Let’s hope he steps on some of them! And he never realized anyone could get in? Harry? Are you talking to someone? Harry? Harry? What’s going on? Harry? Harry, let’s get out, let’s get out! It’s — too — dangerous — ! Harry! He’s dead, Blimey, d’you reckon it’ll still work after that fire? Shall we split up and look — ? Shame he wasn’t concentrating when they mentioned how to stop it, really, If he hadn’t tried to kill us all, I’d be quite sorry he was dead. Right, So you can’t go, that’s what he wants, what he’s expecting. You stay here and look after Hermione, and I’ll go and get it — Don’t even think about it, Argh! And that’s the second time we’ve saved your life tonight, you two-faced bastard! How do we get out? Can’t thank you enough, Let’s get out of range!yelled Ron How — how’re we going to get in? Oh — right — yeah — Harry, we’re coming, just get in there! What? Are you mental? Are you sure?",

No wonder he’s looking so nervous, that’s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn’t want to — everyone knows he’s after Quirrell’s job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.” Must be, Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll if you follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first years coming through! Excuse me, I’m a prefect!” “What’s all this noise?” “I — don’t — want —” “RON!” Oh, hello, Harry, Excellent flying yesterday, really excellent. Gryffindor has just taken the lead for the House Cup — you earned fifty points! “Off you go, off you go, the bell rang five minutes ago, off to class, now,” “Hand it over, Malfoy,” “As a school prefect —” “If you’ve finished eating, I’ll take that seat, Ginny. I’m starving, I’ve only just come off patrol duty.” Harry! I hope you’re well? “It was here, on the bedside table, I took it off for polishing —” My Head Boy badge is gone, You’re not going anywhere till you’ve found my badge! They make a fuss about Hogsmeade, but I assure you, Harry, it’s not all it’s cracked up to be, All right, the sweetshop’s rather good, and Zonko’s Joke Shop’s frankly dangerous, Now, now, Penny, no sabotage! Penelope and I have got a bet on, Ten Galleons on the outcome of the match! Harry — make sure you win, I haven’t got ten Galleons. Yes, I’m coming, Penny! Well done, Harry!  Well done, Harry!  Ten Galleons to me! Must find Penelope, excuse me — Everyone back upstairs! Nonsense! You had too much to eat, Ron — had a nightmare — Now, really, enough’s enough! I certainly didn’t authorize this, Professor!   I was just telling them all to get back to bed! My brother Ron here had a nightmare — If I manage to get into the Ministry, I’ll have a lot of proposals to make about Magical Law Enforcement! Oh, I was wondering who was making all the noise. I’m trying to work in here, you know — I’ve got a report to finish for the office — and it’s rather difficult to concentrate when people keep thundering up and down the stairs. A report for the Department of International Magical Cooperation, We’re trying to standardize cauldron thickness. Some of these foreign imports are just a shade too thin — leakages have been increasing at a rate of almost three percent a year — You might sneer, Ron, but unless some sort of international law is imposed we might well find the market flooded with flimsy, shallow-bottomed products that seriously endanger — Oh, I shudder to think what the state of my in-tray would be if I was away from work for five days. That was a sample of fertilizer from Norway! It was nothing personal! Just Apparated, Dad, You don’t want to go showing Mr. Bagman rubbish like that — Mr. Crouch? He speaks over two hundred! Mermish and Gobbledegook and Troll . . . Mr. Crouch! Would you like a cup of tea? It’s classified information, until such time as the Ministry decides to release it, Mr. Crouch was quite right not to disclose it. Mr. Crouch’s elf? Elf! Running away when he’d expressly told her not to . . . embarrassing him in front of the whole Ministry . . . how would that have looked, if she’d been brought up in front of the Department for the Regulation and Control — Hermione, a wizard in Mr. Crouch’s position can’t afford a house-elf who’s going to run amok with a wand! That woman’s got it in for the Ministry of Magic! Last week she was saying we’re wasting our time quibbling about cauldron thickness, when we should be stamping out vampires! As if it wasn’t specifically stated in paragraph twelve of the Guidelines for the Treatment of Non-Wizard Part-Humans — I’ll come with you, Father, Mr. Crouch will need all hands on deck. And I can give him my cauldron report in person. I’ve been promoted, I’m now Mr. Crouch’s personal assistant, and I’m here representing him. I’m afraid to say Mr. Crouch isn’t well, not well at all. Hasn’t been right since the World Cup. Hardly surprising — overwork. He’s not as young as he was — though still quite brilliant, of course, the mind remains as great as it ever was. But the World Cup was a fiasco for the whole Ministry, and then, Mr. Crouch suffered a huge personal shock with the misbehavior of that house-elf of his, Blinky, or whatever she was called. And then we had the tournament to arrange, and the aftermath of the Cup to deal with — that revolting Skeeter woman buzzing around — no, poor man, he’s having a well-earned, quiet Christmas. I’m just glad he knew he had someone he could rely upon to take his place. Where have you been? The task’s about to start! Yes, sir, Oh, very good, Minister, very good! Yes, Yes, Merry Christmas, Mother. Am I too late? Has it started? I only just found out, so I — I — I was a fool! I was an idiot, I was a pompous prat, I was a — a — Yes, I was! I’m sorry, Dad, It’s been coming on for a while, But I had to find a way out and it’s not so easy at the Ministry, they’re imprisoning traitors all the time. I managed to make contact with Aberforth and he tipped me off ten minutes ago that Hogwarts was going to make a fight of it, so here I am. So, you’re my sister-in-law now?",

Neville’s lost one,” Right, “Well, it’s not very good, is it? I’ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it’s all worked for me. Nobody in my family’s magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it’s the very best school of witchcraft there is, I’ve heard — I’ve learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough — I’m Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?” “What has been going on?” You’d better hurry up and put your robes on, I’ve just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he says we’re nearly there. You haven’t been fighting, have you? You’ll be in trouble before we even get there! It’s bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in Hogwarts: A History. Excuse me. I couldn’t help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying — — and you mustn’t go wandering around the school at night, think of the points you’ll lose Gryffindor if you’re caught, and you’re bound to be. It’s really very selfish of you. “I can’t believe you’re going to do this, Harry.” Don’t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I don’t want Slytherin to win the House Cup, and you’ll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells. All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when you’re on the train home tomorrow, you’re so — “Now what am I going to do?” “I’m coming with you,” “D’you think I’m going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me? If he finds all three of us I’ll tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you can back me up.” “I — told — you,” I — told — you.” No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It’s obviously guarding something. I hope you’re pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed — or worse, expelled. Now, if you don’t mind, I’m going to bed. So I suppose you think that’s a reward for breaking rules? “Wingardium Leviosa!” “Wingardium Leviosa!” Is it — dead? No — he wouldn’t, I know he’s not very nice, but he wouldn’t try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe. You’ve got to eat some breakfast. Just a bit of toast, I knew it, Snape — look. He’s doing something — jinxing the broom, Leave it to me. So why did he just try and kill Harry?  You’ve got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn’t blinking at all, I saw him! We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that’s all, Don’t play, Pretend to break your leg, What happened? Stay there! I knew it! I knew it! “Oh, honestly, don’t you two read? Look — read that, there.” “Just as long as we’re not wiping you off the field,” “Now, don’t forget, it’s Locomotor Mortis,” Come on, Harry! Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game’s over! Harry’s won! We’ve won! Gryffindor is in the lead! Harry, where have you been? So you mean the Stone’s only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to Snape? That’s not ages, that’s like a second to Nicolas Flamel. What am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year? They’re very important, I should have started studying a month ago, I don’t know what’s gotten into me. . . . “What was he hiding behind his back?” So what on earth’s Hagrid up to? We only wondered who had done the guarding, really. We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, apart from you. Snape? “Hagrid, you live in a wooden house,” It’ll all be over at midnight on Saturday, Malfoy’s got detention! I could sing! There’s still Fluffy, though, Go to Dumbledore. That’s what we should have done ages ago. If we try anything ourselves we’ll be thrown out for sure. We’d noticed,” Erm —”“A bit,” “Are there many of them in here?” “Harry! Harry, are you all right?” “Why?” “We want to see Professor Dumbledore,” “But what can we —” “Why me?” “Oh, shut up,” “You’re right, Harry,” Of course not, We’re coming,” “What’s that at its feet?” “No, I don’t!” “What can you see?” “We must be miles under the school,” “Shut up, I’m trying to remember how to kill it!” “Devil’s Snare, Devil’s Snare . . . what did Professor Sprout say? — it likes the dark and the damp —” “Yes — of course — but there’s no wood!” “Oh, right!” “These birds . . . they can’t be here just for decoration,” “How?” “What if he’s — ?” “Look!” Brilliant, This isn’t magic — it’s logic — a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven’t got an ounce of logic, they’d be stuck in here forever. Of course not, Everything we need is here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us safely through the black fire, and one will get us back through the purple. Give me a minute. Got it, The smallest bottle will get us through the black fire — toward the Stone. But Harry — what if You-Know-Who’s with him? Harry — you’re a great wizard, you know. Positive, No — but it’s like ice. Good luck — take care — Harry!   That’s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that — what was it? —‘to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.’ Well, I got back all right, Harry’s gone after him, hasn’t he?’ and hurtled off to the third floor.” Well, if he did — I mean to say — that’s terrible — you could have been killed. There you are! Where have you been? The most ridiculous rumors — someone said you’d been expelled for crashing a flying car — You’re not telling me you did fly here? “It’s all right, he’s still alive,” Defense Against the Dark Arts,” At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in, They got in on pure talent. Ron! Ron! Are you all right? I think you’re being a bit unfair. Professor Dumbledore obviously thought he was the best man for the job — “No thanks,” “Just saying — saying — how nice you look tonight,” “No — honestly — didn’t I just say how nice Myrtle’s looking?” “Oh, dear,” All the copies of Hogwarts: A History have been taken out, And there’s a two-week waiting list. I wish I hadn’t left my copy at home, but I couldn’t fit it in my trunk with all the Lockhart books. The same reason everyone else wants it, to read up on the legend of the Chamber of Secrets. That’s just it. I can’t remember, “What’s a boy in his class saying about you?” “Have you ever seen spiders act like that?” No, I just wanted to show them how — er — nice it is in here. Myrtle, no one wants to upset you, “Honestly, that was almost cheerful for Myrtle. . . . Come on, let’s go.” If you’re talking about Malfoy — Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin? Well, I suppose it’s possible. . . . There might be a way, Of course, it would be difficult. And dangerous, very dangerous. We’d be breaking about fifty school rules, I expect — “All right,” What we’d need to do is to get inside the Slytherin common room and ask Malfoy a few questions without him realizing it’s us. No, it’s not, All we’d need would be some Polyjuice Potion. Snape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago — It transforms you into somebody else. Think about it! We could change into three of the Slytherins. No one would know it was us. Malfoy would probably tell us anything. He’s probably boasting about it in the Slytherin common room right now, if only we could hear him. Wait till everyone’s gone, All right . . . Here it is, This is the most complicated potion I’ve ever seen, Lacewing flies, leeches, fluxweed, and knotgrass, Well, they’re easy enough, they’re in the student store-cupboard, we can help ourselves. . . . Oooh, look, powdered horn of a bicorn — don’t know where we’re going to get that — shredded skin of a boomslang — that’ll be tricky, too — and of course a bit of whoever we want to change into. We don’t have to worry about that yet, though, because we add those bits last. . . . I don’t want to break rules, you know. I think threatening Muggle-borns is far worse than brewing up a difficult potion. But if you don’t want to find out if it’s Malfoy, I’ll go straight to Madam Pince now and hand the book back in — Well, since the fluxweed has got to be picked at the full moon and the lacewings have got to be stewed for twenty-one days . . . I’d say it’d be ready in about a month, if we can get all the ingredients. “Do you think he’s all right?” Wake up, Merry Christmas to you, too, I’ve been up for nearly an hour, adding more lacewings to the potion. It’s ready. Positive, If we’re going to do it, I say it should be tonight. We still need a bit of the people you’re changing into, And obviously, it’ll be best if you can get something of Crabbe’s and Goyle’s; they’re Malfoy’s best friends, he’ll tell them anything. And we also need to make sure the real Crabbe and Goyle can’t burst in on us while we’re interrogating him. The potion will be useless without Crabbe’s and Goyle’s hair, You do want to investigate Malfoy, don’t you? Remember Millicent Bulstrode wrestling with me at the Dueling Club? She left this on my robes when she was trying to strangle me! And she’s gone home for Christmas — so I’ll just have to tell the Slytherins I’ve decided to come back. Did you get them? You’ll need bigger sizes once you’re Crabbe and Goyle. I’m sure I’ve done everything right, It looks like the book says it should . . . once we’ve drunk it, we’ll have exactly an hour before we change back into ourselves. We separate it into three glasses and add the hairs. Add yours, then, I — I don’t think I’m going to come after all. You go on without me. No — really — I don’t think I’ll come. You two hurry up, you’re wasting time — “Fine — I’m fine — go on —” “Go away!” M-Millicent Bulstrode m-must have a cat! And the p-potion isn’t supposed to be used for animal transformations! Oooh, it might have hidden powers, Well, the Chamber of Secrets was opened fifty years ago, wasn’t it? That’s what Malfoy said. And this diary is fifty years old, Oh, Ron, wake up, We know the person who opened the Chamber last time was expelled fifty years ago. We know T. M. Riddle got an award for special services to the school fifty years ago. Well, what if Riddle got his special award for catching the Heir of Slytherin? His diary would probably tell us everything — It might be invisible ink!  Aparecium! “It’s a Revealer, I got it in Diagon Alley,” “But the monster had killed someone, Ron,” “Do you think we should go and ask Hagrid about it all?” “It could affect our whole future,” “But that’s very important!” But — only a Gryffindor could have stolen — nobody else knows our password — Harry — I think I’ve just understood something! I’ve got to go to the library! Did you really blow up your aunt, Harry? It’s not funny, Ron, Honestly, I’m amazed Harry wasn’t expelled. Mum and Dad dropped me off this morning with all my Hogwarts things. Well, I’m taking more new subjects than you, aren’t I? Those are my books for Arithmancy, Care of Magical Creatures, Divination, Study of Ancient Runes, Muggle Studies — But it’ll be fascinating to study them from the Wizarding point of view, I’ve still got ten Galleons, It’s my birthday in September, and Mum and Dad gave me some money to get myself an early birthday present. No, I don’t think so, I really want an owl. I mean, Harry’s got Hedwig and you’ve got Errol — He’s gorgeous, isn’t he? He didn’t mean to, did you, Crookshanks? That reminds me, you forgot your rat tonic, Poor Crookshanks, that witch said he’d been in there for ages; no one wanted him. It’s all right, Crookshanks, I’ll let you out on the train. Professor R. J. Lupin, It’s on his case, That’s obvious, There’s only one vacancy, isn’t there? Defense Against the Dark Arts. Harry, Oh, Harry . . . you’ll have to be really, really careful. Don’t go looking for trouble, Harry — But they’ll catch him, won’t they? Is that a Sneakoscope? Were you doing anything untrustworthy at the time? I’ve read it’s the only entirely non-Muggle settlement in Britain — What’s that? But Hogsmeade’s a very interesting place, isn’t it? In Sites of Historical Sorcery it says the inn was the headquarters for the 1612 goblin rebellion, and the Shrieking Shack’s supposed to be the most severely haunted building in Britain — Won’t it be nice to get out of school for a bit and explore Hogsmeade? Oh, Ron, don’t talk rubbish, Black’s already murdered a whole bunch of people in the middle of a crowded street. Do you really think he’s going to worry about attacking Harry just because we’re there? Ron, don’t! Er — Professor? Excuse me — Professor? I’m not, “Ron,” “be careful . . .” We can’t be there yet, Ouch! Ron, that was my foot! Dunno . . . I’m going to go and ask the driver what’s going on, Ginny? Arthur, what are you doing? I was looking for Ron — Harry? And Professor Lupin stepped over you, and walked toward the dementor, and pulled out his wand, But the dementor didn’t move, so Lupin muttered something, and a silvery thing shot out of his wand at it,  and it turned around and sort of glided away. Ignore him, Just ignore him, it’s not worth it. . . . “Ooh, good, we’re starting some new subjects today,” I’ll manage. I’ve fixed it all with Professor McGonagall. Don’t be silly, Of course I won’t be in three classes at once. Pass the marmalade, Oh, Ron, what’s it to you if my schedule’s a bit full? I told you, I’ve fixed it all with Professor McGonagall. I think it’s this way, But everyone knows that, Well, they do, Everybody knows about Harry and You-Know-Who. “I don’t think it looks like a Grim,” I don’t know, You haven’t been fired, Hagrid! It’s all Malfoy’s fault, Hagrid! I think you’ve had enough to drink, Hagrid, Stuck his head in the water barrel, Sir, please, I could help Neville put it right — It’s a shape-shifter, It can take the shape of whatever it thinks will frighten us most. Harry, I’m sure you’ll be able to go next time, They’re bound to catch Black soon. He’s been sighted once already. Clever Crookshanks, did you catch that all by yourself? Ron, don’t hurt him! Crookshanks doesn’t understand it’s wrong! All cats chase rats, Ron! Oh, what rubbish, Crookshanks could smell him, Ron, how else d’you think — What did you do? Did you get any work done? We’d better go down, you know, the feast’ll be starting in five minutes. . . . Please, sir, But, sir, we’re not supposed to do werewolves yet, we’re due to start hinkypunks — Please, sir, the werewolf differs from the true wolf in several small ways. The snout of the werewolf — I don’t know, But I really hope Professor Lupin gets better soon. . . . Ron! I’ve had an idea, Harry! Give me your glasses, quick! Impervius! There! They’ll repel water! Okay, team, let’s go for it! Dumbledore was really angry, I’ve never seen him like that before. He ran onto the field as you fell, waved his wand, and you sort of slowed down before you hit the ground. Then he whirled his wand at the dementors. Shot silver stuff at them. They left the stadium right away. . . . He was furious they’d come onto the grounds. We heard him — Hmm . . . And it hit — it hit — oh, Harry — it hit the Whomping Willow. Professor Flitwick brought it back just before you came around, It’s okay! Oh no, I’ve already finished it! We can do all our Christmas shopping there! Mum and Dad would really love those Toothflossing Stringmints from Honeydukes! Ugh, no, Harry won’t want one of those, they’re for vampires, I expect, Harry! What are you doing here? But Harry isn’t going to keep it! He’s going to hand it in to Professor McGonagall, aren’t you, Harry? But what about Sirius Black? He could be using one of the passages on that map to get into the castle! The teachers have got to know! Yes, Look, Harry still shouldn’t be coming into Hogsmeade. He hasn’t got a signed form! If anyone finds out, he’ll be in so much trouble! And it’s not nightfall yet — what if Sirius Black turns up today? Now? Oh — of course not — but honestly, Harry — Seen the Fizzing Whizbees, Harry? And the Jelly Slugs? And the Acid Pops? Fred gave me one of those when I was seven — it burnt a hole right through my tongue. I remember Mum walloping him with her broomstick. Reckon Fred’d take a bit of Cockroach Cluster if I told him they were peanuts? You really don’t look well, you know, Harry, listen, you must be really upset about what we heard yesterday. But the thing is, you mustn’t go doing anything stupid. Harry? There’s nothing you can do! The dementors will catch Black and he’ll go back to Azkaban and — and serve him right! You heard what Fudge said. Black isn’t affected by Azkaban like normal people are. It’s not a punishment for him like it is for the others. You want to — to kill Black or something? Harry? Harry doesn’t want to kill anyone, do you, Harry? — and Malfoy’d love to see you blown into about a million pieces, like Pettigrew! Get a grip. Malfoy’s just hoping you’ll get yourself killed before he has to play you at Quidditch. Harry, please, please be sensible. Black did a terrible, terrible thing, but d-don’t put yourself in danger, it’s what Black wants. . . . Oh, Harry, you’d be playing right into Black’s hands if you went looking for him. Your mum and dad wouldn’t want you to get hurt, would they?   They’d never want you to go looking for Black! No! Harry isn’t supposed to leave the castle, Ron — He’s not out, is he? Hagrid, what is it? You’ll have to put up a good strong defense, Hagrid, I’m sure you can prove Buckbeak is safe. I’m sure I’ve read about a case of hippogriff-baiting, where the hippogriff got off. I’ll look it up for you, Hagrid, and see exactly what happened. We do like them! Is it awful in there, Hagrid? But you were innocent! Look, No! What? Who sent it to you? Who sent you that? No idea, but it’s a bit odd, isn’t it? I mean, this is supposed to be quite a good broom, isn’t it? So it must’ve been really expensive. . . . Well, I don’t think anyone should ride that broom just yet! No! I want a quick word with Professor McGonagall. Because I thought — and Professor McGonagall agrees with me — that that broom was probably sent to Harry by Sirius Black! Nothing, Ah, Fine, Well — there might have been! I mean, at least you know now that it’s safe! I suppose so, Oh, well — you know — working hard, I couldn’t do that! It’s my favorite subject! It’s — What! N-no, Okay, side with Ron, I knew you would! First the Firebolt, now Scabbers, everything’s my fault, isn’t it! Just leave me alone, Harry, I’ve got a lot of work to do! Of course I did, And I’m very glad we won, and I think you did really well, but I need to read this by Monday. Harry! Harry, if you go into Hogsmeade again . . . I’ll tell Professor McGonagall about that map! Ron, how can you let him go with you? After what Sirius Black nearly did to you! I mean it, I’ll tell — “No,” “No,” I just thought you ought to know . . . Hagrid lost his case. Buckbeak is going to be executed. W-what? Is it time to go? W-which lesson have we got now? What? Oh no! I forgot to go to Charms! I don’t believe it! Was Professor Flitwick angry? No, I’m not! I just made a mistake, that’s all! I’d better go and see Professor Flitwick and say sorry. . . . I’ll see you in Divination! I can’t believe I missed Cheering Charms! And I bet they come up in our exams; Professor Flitwick hinted they might! Well, honestly . . . ‘the fates have informed her’ . . . who sets the exam? She does! What an amazing prediction! This is such a waste of time, I could be practicing something useful. I could be catching up on Cheering Charms — Oh, for goodness’ sake! Not that ridiculous Grim again! “Fine!” “Fine!” “I give up! I’m leaving!” I can’t work, I can’t concentrate, You’re going to be fine, As long as Hagrid keeps his head this time, and argues his case properly, they can’t possibly execute Buckbeak. . . . Where is it? Yeah, If he sees you. . . . How do you open the witch’s hump again? Hagrid Hagrid Hagrid Ron! I — I don’t believe it — it’s Scabbers! They can’t kill him — How — could — they? How could they? Crookshanks! Ron! Harry — we’ve got to go for help — We’re never going to get through without help — Oh, help, help, please . . . Crookshanks! How did he know — ? Where’s Ron? Where does this tunnel come out? Harry, I think we’re in the Shrieking Shack. Ron — are you okay? Harry! Harry! Be quiet! WE’RE UP HERE! WE’RE UP HERE — SIRIUS BLACK — QUICK! I DON’T BELIEVE IT! You — you — — you and him! Harry, Ages, Since I did Professor Snape’s essay. . . . “Both,” I’m not, If I’d been a bit cleverer, I’d have told everyone what you are! Ridiculous! But Professor Lupin . . . Scabbers can’t be Pettigrew . . . it just can’t be true, you know it can’t . . . Because . . . because people would know if Peter Pettigrew had been an Animagus. We did Animagi in class with Professor McGonagall. And I looked them up when I did my homework — the Ministry of Magic keeps tabs on witches and wizards who can become animals; there’s a register showing what animal they become, and their markings and things . . . and I went and looked Professor McGonagall up on the register, and there have been only seven Animagi this century, and Pettigrew’s name wasn’t on the list — Shh! But how did that help you? We attacked a teacher. . . . We attacked a teacher . . . , Oh, we’re going to be in so much trouble — What do you mean? Professor Lupin? Can — can I say something? Well — Scabbers — I mean, this — this man — he’s been sleeping in Harry’s dormitory for three years. If he’s working for You-Know-Who, how come he never tried to hurt Harry before now? Er — Mr. Black — Sirius? If you don’t mind me asking, how — how did you get out of Azkaban, if you didn’t use Dark Magic? What about Professor Snape? What did he do to him? “Come —” Minister, listen, please, I saw him too. It was Ron’s rat, he’s an Animagus, Pettigrew, I mean, and — Professor! — he’s a rat — — Pettigrew attacked Ron, it wasn’t Sirius — But — Quick! Quick! “Ready? In here! We’ve gone back in time, Three hours back . . . Shh! Listen! Someone’s coming! I think — I think it might be us! Yes, I’m sure it’s us. It doesn’t sound like more than three people . . . and we’re walking slowly because we’re under the Invisibility Cloak — We’ve gone down the front steps. . . . It’s called a Time-Turner, and I got it from Professor McGonagall on our first day back. I’ve been using it all year to get to all my lessons. Professor McGonagall made me swear I wouldn’t tell anyone. She had to tell them that I was a model student, and that I’d never, ever use it for anything except my studies. . . . I’ve been turning it back so I could do hours over again, that’s how I’ve been doing several lessons at once, see? But . . . Harry, I don’t understand what Dumbledore wants us to do. Why did he tell us to go back three hours? How’s that going to help Sirius? This is three hours ago, and we are walking down to Hagrid’s, We just heard ourselves leaving. . . . But — how will that help Sirius? If we manage that without being seen, it’ll be a miracle! If anyone’s looking out of the window — Okay, but we’ll go around by the greenhouses! We need to keep out of sight of Hagrid’s front door, or we’ll see us! We must be nearly at Hagrid’s by now! Right, We need to sneak over to Hagrid’s. . . . Keep out of sight, Harry. . . . Let’s move along a bit, We need to get nearer to Buckbeak! No! If we steal him now, those Committee people will think Hagrid set him free! We’ve got to wait until they’ve seen he’s tied outside! No! Don’t you understand? We’re breaking one of the most important Wizarding laws! Nobody’s supposed to change time, nobody! You heard Dumbledore, if we’re seen — Harry, what do you think you’d do if you saw yourself bursting into Hagrid’s house? Exactly! You wouldn’t understand, you might even attack yourself! Don’t you see? Professor McGonagall told me what awful things have happened when wizards have meddled with time. . . . Loads of them ended up killing their past or future selves by mistake! We’re about to come out! Harry, Look! Did anyone see you? Harry, Harry, Right, We’ve got about forty-five minutes until Dumbledore locks the door to the hospital wing. We’ve got to rescue Sirius and get back into the ward before anybody realizes we’re missing. . . . Look! Who’s that? Someone’s coming back out of the castle! Stand back! We’ve got exactly ten minutes to get back down to the hospital wing without anybody seeing us — before Dumbledore locks the door — Sirius “Three minutes, Harry!” That’s wonderful! — doesn’t sound like there’s anything we can do — Why don’t you show Harry where he’s sleeping, Ron? We can all go, Out in the garden, I expect, He likes chasing gnomes. He’s never seen any before. Have you had a good summer,  Did you get our food parcels and everything? I think they’ve stopped arguing, Shall we go down and help your mum with dinner? I wonder what the Bulgarians have got dangling all over their tents? What? He looks really grumpy, Come here, Mr. Weasley, Oooh, thanks, Harry, And I’ll get us some programs, look — ‘A display from the team mascots will precede the match,’ Harry, what are you doing? Honestly! Harry, if you’re not going to watch at normal speed, you’re going to miss things! Look at the referee! They’re going to crash! He was very brave, wasn’t he? He looks a terrible mess. . . . What happened? Ron, where are you? Oh this is stupid — Lumos! What’s that supposed to mean? Never mind, Ron, Oh come on, let’s go and find the others. C’mon, Well, with any luck, the Ministry will catch him! Oh I can’t believe this. Where have the others got to? Beauxbatons, They must go to Beauxbatons, You know . . . Beauxbatons Academy of Magic . . . I read about it in An Appraisal of Magical Education in Europe. You’re kidding! Maybe it fell out of your pocket when we were running? You know, house-elves get a very raw deal! It’s slavery, that’s what it is! That Mr. Crouch made her go up to the top of the stadium, and she was terrified, and he’s got her bewitched so she can’t even run when they start trampling tents! Why doesn’t anyone do something about it? It’s people like you, Ron, who prop up rotten and unjust systems, just because they’re too lazy to — Honestly! I reckon we can just wait here, you know. We’ll hear anyone coming a mile off. Not exactly on top of things, Mr. Bagman, is he? I hope the others are okay, Those poor Muggles, though, What if they can’t get them down? Mad, though, to do something like that when the whole Ministry of Magic’s out here tonight! I mean, how do they expect to get away with it? Do you think they’ve been drinking, or are they just — Harry, come on, move! It’s the Dark Mark, Harry! You-Know-Who’s sign! Harry, come on! Over there, There was someone behind the trees . . . they shouted words — an incantation — It wasn’t her! Winky’s got a squeaky little voice, and the voice we heard doing the incantation was much deeper! It didn’t sound anything like Winky, did it? But she was frightened! Your elf’s scared of heights, and those wizards in masks were levitating people! You can’t blame her for wanting to get out of their way! She didn’t do anything — she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time! She didn’t run amok! She just picked it up off the ground! I told you, it’s You-Know-Who’s symbol, Ron, I read about it in The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts. So . . . whoever conjured the Dark Mark . . . were they doing it to show support for the Death Eaters, or to scare them away? Yes, Oh Harry, you aren’t going to pay attention to anything that old fraud says? Why were you asking if Hedwig had come, Harry? Are you expecting a letter? But we don’t know where Sirius is . . . he could be in Africa or somewhere, couldn’t he? Hedwig’s not going to manage that journey in a few days. Ron, Harry doesn’t want to play Quidditch right now. . . . He’s worried, and he’s tired. . . . We all need to go to bed. . . . Boys. Thanks for having us to stay, Mrs. Weasley, Shh! So he thinks Durmstrang would have suited him, does he? I wish he had gone, then we wouldn’t have to put up with him. Yes, and it’s got a horrible reputation. According to An Appraisal of Magical Education in Europe, it puts a lot of emphasis on the Dark Arts. Well, nobody knows, do they? There’s traditionally been a lot of rivalry between all the magic schools. Durmstrang and Beauxbatons like to conceal their whereabouts so nobody can steal their secrets, But Hogwarts is hidden, It’s bewitched, If a Muggle looks at it, all they see is a moldering old ruin with a sign over the entrance saying DANGER, DO NOT ENTER, UNSAFE. Maybe, or it might have Muggle-repelling charms on it, like the World Cup stadium. And to keep foreign wizards from finding it, they’ll have made it Unplottable — Well, you can enchant a building so it’s impossible to plot on a map, can’t you? But I think Durmstrang must be somewhere in the far north, Somewhere very cold, because they’ve got fur capes as part of their uniforms. Either explain what you’re on about or go away, Malfoy, Ron! Reparo! Oooh, I wouldn’t fancy crossing the lake in this weather, Oh no, not necessarily, You’d think they’d be together, wouldn’t you? Where’s the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher? Maybe they couldn’t get anyone! There are house-elves here? Here at Hogwarts? I’ve never seen one! But they get paid? They get holidays, don’t they? And — and sick leave, and pensions, and everything? Slave labor, That’s what made this dinner. Slave labor. Hmph! Wha’ ’appened? What happened to his face? Death toll? Come on, we’ll be the only ones left here if you don’t move. People have died, though! You should have given it up like me, shouldn’t you? Then you’d be doing something sensible like Arithmancy. I’ve decided there are better ways of making a stand about elf rights, Lots of homework? Professor Vector didn’t give us any at all! The what? Got to, Loads to do. It’s not schoolwork, Been in the — Stop it! Avada Kedavra, Hurry up, No, Neville. Neville? Neville, are you all right? What was that about? What does it say? He’s flying north? He’s coming back? Harry Harry You didn’t imagine your scar hurting and you know it. But — but you said it’s illegal, Professor, He’s not an idiot. You just don’t like him because he beat Gryffindor at Quidditch, I’ve heard he’s a really good student — and he’s a prefect. Excuse me, I don’t like people just because they’re handsome! Well, the Heads of the participating schools are always on the panel, because all three of them were injured during the Tournament of 1792, when a cockatrice the champions were supposed to be catching went on the rampage. It’s all in Hogwarts: A History. Though, of course, that book’s not entirely reliable. A Revised History of Hogwarts would be a more accurate title. Or A Highly Biased and Selective History of Hogwarts, Which Glosses Over the Nastier Aspects of the School. House-elves! Not once, in over a thousand pages, does Hogwarts: A History mention that we are all colluding in the oppression of a hundred slaves! No, of course not, That’s because they’re uneducated and brainwashed! Hedwig’ll attract too much attention, She stands out. A snowy owl that keeps returning to wherever he’s hiding . . . I mean, they’re not native birds, are they? I doubt it, I don’t think so . . . not from that far away. . . . You can’t Apparate inside the Hogwarts grounds, how often do I have to tell you? Oh don’t say that, Imagine that lot loose on the grounds. . . . For heaven’s sake, Ron, he’s only a Quidditch player, Really, All the Durmstrang lot, But I haven’t seen anyone from Hogwarts yet. I’m not sure this is going to work, you know, I’m sure Dumbledore will have thought of this. Listen! Are you seventeen, then? Well, I’m glad someone from Gryffindor’s entering, I really hope you get it, Angelina! I’ve just realized — I haven’t asked Hagrid to join S.P. E.W. yet! Wait for me, will you, while I nip upstairs and get the badges? But Harry set Dobby free, and he was over the moon about it! And we heard he’s asking for wages now! Is that aftershave? Eau de cologne? Hagrid? He’s going up to the castle with her! I thought he was waiting for us! So do I! Well, we’ll soon know! Oh look, they’re all disappointed, Hello, I brought you this. . . . Want to go for a walk? Well, of course I knew you hadn’t entered yourself, The look on your face when Dumbledore read out your name! But the question is, who did put it in? Because Moody’s right, Harry . . . I don’t think any student could have done it . . . they’d never be able to fool the goblet, or get over Dumbledore’s — Erm . . . yes . . . he was at breakfast, Well . . . no, I don’t think so . . . not really, Oh Harry, isn’t it obvious? He’s jealous! Look, it’s always you who gets all the attention, you know it is. I know it’s not your fault, I know you don’t ask for it . . . but — well — you know, Ron’s got all those brothers to compete against at home, and you’re his best friend, and you’re really famous — he’s always shunted to one side whenever people see you, and he puts up with it, and he never mentions it, but I suppose this is just one time too many. . . . I’m not telling him anything, Tell him yourself. It’s the only way to sort this out. That’s not funny, That’s not funny at all. Harry, I’ve been thinking — you know what we’ve got to do, don’t you? Straight away, the moment we get back to the castle? Write to Sirius. You’ve got to tell him what’s happened. He asked you to keep him posted on everything that’s going on at Hogwarts. . . . It’s almost as if he expected something like this to happen. I brought some parchment and a quill out with me — Harry, this isn’t going to be kept quiet, This tournament’s famous, and you’re famous. I’ll be really surprised if there isn’t anything in the Daily Prophet about you competing. . . . You’re already in half the books about You-Know-Who, you know . . . and Sirius would rather hear it from you, I know he would. Ask Ron if you can borrow — Well, borrow one of the school owls, then, anyone can use them, It’s really not that difficult, Harry, ignore them, ignore them, Oh very funny, really witty. Harry! Ignore it, Just ignore it, Harry. You miss him! . . . well I thought we might meet up with him in the Three Broomsticks. . . . Oh Harry, this is so stupid — Oh all right then . . . but I hate talking to you in that Cloak, I never know if I’m looking at you or not. I look like such an idiot, sitting here on my own, Lucky I brought something to do. You know, maybe I should try and get some of the villagers involved in S.P. E.W., When house-elves have decent wages and working conditions! You know, I’m starting to think it’s time for more direct action. I wonder how you get into the school kitchens? Look, it’s Hagrid! Hello, Does he? I wonder what he’s up to? I don’t know whether you should go, Harry. . . . It might make you late for Sirius. Let’s just try and keep you alive until Tuesday evening, and then we can worry about Karkaroff. ‘Talon-clipping by charms . . . treating scale-rot . . .’ This is no good, this is for nutters like Hagrid who want to keep them healthy. . . . ‘Dragons are extremely difficult to slay, owing to the ancient magic that imbues their thick hides, which none but the most powerful spells can penetrate . . .’ But Sirius said a simple one would do it. . . . Well, there are Switching Spells . . . but what’s the point of Switching it? Unless you swapped its fangs for wine-gums or something that would make it less dangerous. . . . The trouble is, like that book said, not much is going to get through a dragon’s hide. . . . I’d say Transfigure it, but something that big, you really haven’t got a hope, I doubt even Professor McGonagall . . . unless you’re supposed to put the spell on yourself? Maybe to give yourself extra powers? But they’re not simple spells, I mean, we haven’t done any of those in class, I only know about them because I’ve been doing O. W.L. practice papers. . . . Oh no, he’s back again, why can’t he read on his stupid ship? Come on, Harry, we’ll go back to the common room . . . his fan club’ll be here in a moment, twittering away. . . . Harry, you’ll be late, the bell’s about to ring — What d’you think I’ve been trying to do, Harry? Concentrate, Harry, concentrate. . . . That’s better, Harry, that’s loads better, Harry, I really think you’ve got it! It’s all right, Just as long as you’re concentrating really, really hard on it, it’ll come. Harry, we’d better get some sleep . . . you’re going to need it. Good luck, Harry, You’ll be fine! Harry, you were brilliant! You were amazing! You really were! Harry, You two are so stupid! He’s supposed to work out the clue on his own, It’s in the tournament rules. . . . Did you get all this from the kitchens, Fred? How do you get in there? Nothing, They’re very interesting, aren’t they? Aren’t they, Harry? Just as long as he didn’t import those skrewts illegally or anything, You’ll see, you’ll see in a minute! Oh dear, Winky, don’t cry, please don’t . . . Good for you, Dobby! That’s not very much! And how much is Professor Dumbledore paying you, Winky? Ashamed? But — Winky, come on! It’s Mr. Crouch who should be ashamed, not you! You didn’t do anything wrong, he was really horrible to you — Winky, I’m quite sure Mr. Crouch is getting along perfectly well without you. We’ve seen him, you know — Yes, he and Mr. Bagman are judges in the Triwizard Tournament. I think this is the best thing that could have happened to those elves, you know, Dobby coming to work here, I mean. The other elves will see how happy he is, being free, and slowly it’ll dawn on them that they want that too! Oh she’ll cheer up, Once the shock’s worn off, and she’s got used to Hogwarts, she’ll see how much better off she is without that Crouch man. Probably says he’s not a very good Head of Department, and let’s face it . . . he’s got a point, hasn’t he? Don’t let Percy hear you saying that, Mmm . . . you’re not exactly straining yourself, though, are you? I’d have thought you’d be doing something constructive, Harry, even if you don’t want to learn your antidotes! That egg! But it might take weeks to work it out! You’re going to look a real idiot if everyone else knows what the next task is and you don’t! Why weren’t you two at dinner? All the good-looking ones taken, Ron? Eloise Midgen starting to look quite pretty now, is she? Well, I’m sure you’ll find someone somewhere who’ll have you. Oh well spotted, No, I can’t, I can’t come with you, because I’m already going with someone. Oh did I? Just because it’s taken you three years to notice, Ron, doesn’t mean no one else has spotted I’m a girl! That’s what Krum did! But he’s right, Harry, you have still got two tasks to do. You really ought to have a look at that egg, you know, and start working out what it means. . . . Oh I suppose not, Hi, Hi, Parvati! Her-my-oh-nee, Close enough, It’s hot, isn’t it? Viktor’s just gone to get some drinks. What about them? Ron, what — ? Don’t be so stupid! The enemy! Who was the one who wanted his autograph? Who’s got a model of him up in their dormitory? How’s it going? So what? No, I wasn’t! If you really want to know, he — he said he’d been coming up to the library every day to try and talk to me, but he hadn’t been able to pluck up the courage! And what’s that supposed to mean? For your information, he hasn’t asked me one single thing about Harry, not one — I’d never help him work out that egg! This whole tournament’s supposed to be about getting to know foreign wizards and making friends with them! Don’t call him Vicky! Well, if you don’t like it, you know what the solution is, don’t you? Next time there’s a ball, ask me before someone else does, and not as a last resort! Hurry up, now, the bell rang five minutes ago, good “How did that horrible Skeeter woman find out? You don’t think Hagrid told her?” “Maybe she heard him telling Madame Maxime at the ball,” “Like you and Ron did, you mean,” “I — well, I’m not going to pretend it didn’t make a nice change, having a proper Care of Magical Creatures lesson for once — but I do want Hagrid back, of course I do!” “I just thought you’d want to take advantage of the common room being quiet, Really get to work on that egg.” “Well done!” He shouldn’t be doing that! He’s one of the judges! And anyway, you’ve already worked it out — haven’t you? Those goblins didn’t look very friendly, What were they doing here? Funny, goblins looking for Mr. Crouch. . . . They’d normally deal with the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. Ha, ha, ha, Goblins don’t need protection. Haven’t you been listening to what Professor Binns has been telling us about goblin rebellions? Well, they’re quite capable of dealing with wizards, They’re very clever. They’re not like house-elves, who never stick up for themselves. Come back and teach, Hagrid, please come back, we really miss you. You said you’d already worked out that egg clue! Oh Ron, we thought Snape was trying to kill Harry before, and it turned out he was saving Harry’s life, remember? I don’t care what Moody says, Dumbledore’s not stupid. He was right to trust Hagrid and Professor Lupin, even though loads of people wouldn’t have given them jobs, so why shouldn’t he be right about Snape, even if Snape is a bit — Why has Mr. Crouch been pretending to be ill? It’s a bit funny, isn’t it, that he can’t manage to come to the Yule Ball, but he can get up here in the middle of the night when he wants to? You just want to think Snape’s up to something, Of course, the ideal solution would be for you to Transfigure yourself into a submarine or something, If only we’d done human Transfiguration already! But I don’t think we start that until sixth year, and it can go badly wrong if you don’t know what you’re doing. . . . I don’t think he’d let you choose what you wanted to be turned into, though, No, I think your best chance is some sort of charm. Weekend after next, Here — take my quill and send this owl back straight away. There must be something, They’d never have set a task that was undoable. There’s a way of doing it! There just has to be! It takes years to become an Animagus, and then you have to register yourself and everything, Professor McGonagall told us, remember . . . you’ve got to register yourself with the Improper Use of Magic Office . . . what animal you become, and your markings, so you can’t abuse it. . . . Oh this is no use, Who on earth wants to make their nose hair grow into ringlets? What? “What’re you two doing here?” Harry, Bring as many of these books as you can, okay? Harry, You did it, you found out how all by yourself! Harry, Scarlet woman? If that’s the best Rita can do, she’s losing her touch, What a pile of old rubbish. There’s something funny, though, Don’t be stupid, No, it’s just . . . how did she know Viktor asked me to visit him over the summer? He asked me right after he’d pulled me out of the lake, After he’d got rid of his shark’s head. Madam Pomfrey gave us both blankets and then he sort of pulled me away from the judges so they wouldn’t hear, and he said, if I wasn’t doing anything over the summer, would I like to — And he did say he’d never felt the same way about anyone else, She wasn’t there ... or was she?  Maybe she has got an Invisibility Cloak;maybe she sneaked onto the grounds to watch the second task. . . . Well, I was too busy seeing whether you and Harry were okay to — Getting his comeuppance for sacking Winky, isn’t he? I bet he wishes he hadn’t done it now — bet he feels the difference now she’s not there to look after him. Winky didn’t steal that wand! We saw him in the forest just before the Dark Mark appeared, Remember? How d’you know? How d’you know where he Disapparated to? It’s more likely he did it than Winky, Yes, he sacked her, just because she hadn’t stayed in her tent and let herself get trampled — Crouch’s son was caught? Did Crouch try and get his son off? Look, I don’t care what you say, Dumbledore trusts Snape — Why did Snape save Harry’s life in the first year, then? Why didn’t he just let him die? It’s half past three, You’ve just had breakfast! Dobby, where’s Winky? Oh dear, But we’re not sure if that’s true, Other people manage to do their own housework, you know, Winky, She’s unhappy! Why don’t you try and cheer her up instead of covering her up? Oh for heaven’s sake! Listen to me, all of you! You’ve got just as much right as wizards to be unhappy! You’ve got the right to wages and holidays and proper clothes, you don’t have to do everything you’re told — look at Dobby! Oh as if you care about that! You only like coming down here for the food! Oh for heaven’s sake! Well, we know what to get you next Christmas, Come on, Ron, it could be worse. At least your fingers aren’t full of pus. I hate that Skeeter woman! I’ll get her back for this if it’s the last thing I do! I want to know how she’s listening into private conversations when she’s supposed to be banned from the grounds! Well, Rita’s definitely not using an Invisibility Cloak! Moody says he didn’t see her anywhere near the judges’ table at the second task, or anywhere near the lake! No! I want to know how she heard me talking to Viktor! And how she found out about Hagrid’s mum! Aren’t you two ever going to read Hogwarts: A History? All those substitutes for magic Muggles use — electricity, computers, and radar, and all those things — they all go haywire around Hogwarts, there’s too much magic in the air. No, Rita’s using magic to eavesdrop, she must be. . . . If I could just find out what it is . . . ooh, if it’s illegal, I’ll have her . . . I’m not asking you to help! I’ll do it on my own! Your mum doesn’t read Witch Weekly, by any chance, does she, Ron? You can’t Disapparate on the Hogwarts grounds, haven’t I told you enough times? And Mr. Crouch evaporated, did he? Just go through it again, Harry, What did Mr. Crouch actually say? Well, that was his fault, We need to see Professor Moody, We need to find out whether he found Mr. Crouch. Shh! You don’t think they know something about all this, do you? About Crouch and everything? What’s the matter? Yes, but . . . they wouldn’t do anything against the law to get gold. Yes, but this is the law, This isn’t some silly school rule. . . . They’ll get a lot more than detention for blackmail! Ron . . . maybe you’d better tell Percy. . . . D’you think it’s too early to go and see Professor Moody? You can’t Disapparate on the grounds, Ron! There are other ways he could have disappeared, aren’t there, Professor? But under his own steam? or because someone made him? Ha! She hasn’t got wind of Crouch! “They couldn’t have made it look like an accident if they’d murdered you in the forest! But if you die during a task —” I’m not worrying about her, I’m just thinking . . . remember what she said to me in the Three Broomsticks? ’ This is what she meant, isn’t it? She reported his trial, she knew he’d passed information to the Death Eaters. ’ Mr. Crouch would have been furious he got off, he would have talked about it at home. Of course she doesn’t, Look what happened to Hagrid when Rita found out about his mother. Look at Fudge, jumping to conclusions about her, just because she’s part giant. Who needs that sort of prejudice? I’d probably say I had big bones if I knew that’s what I’d get for telling the truth. We haven’t done any practicing! We were going to do the Impediment Curse! We’ll have to really get down to it tomorrow! Come on, Harry, you need to get some sleep. “Yes,” Hello, Oh . . . yes . . . all right, There’s nothing in there. You can look for yourself, but there’s nothing at all. I’ve been checking every day. Just a small piece the day after the third task saying you won the tournament. They didn’t even mention Cedric. Nothing about any of it. If you ask me, Fudge is forcing them to keep quiet. Oh, Rita hasn’t written anything at all since the third task, As a matter of fact, Not unless she wants me to spill the beans on her. I found out how she was listening in on private conversations when she wasn’t supposed to be coming onto the grounds, Well, it was you, really, who gave me the idea, Harry, Bugging, Oh not electronic bugs, She can turn — — into a beetle. Oh yes she is, No, I’m not, I caught her on the windowsill in the hospital wing. Look very closely, and you’ll notice the markings around her antennae are exactly like those foul glasses she wears. Exactly, And Viktor pulled a beetle out of my hair after we’d had our conversation by the lake. And unless I’m very much mistaken, Rita was perched on the windowsill of the Divination class the day your scar hurt. She’s been buzzing around for stories all year. He was talking to her, in his hand, He knew, of course. That’s how she’s been getting all those nice little interviews with the Slytherins. They wouldn’t care that she was doing something illegal, as long as they were giving her horrible stuff about us and Hagrid. I’ve told her I’ll let her out when we get back to London, I’ve put an Unbreakable Charm on the jar, you see, so she can’t transform. And I’ve told her she’s to keep her quill to herself for a whole year. See if she can’t break the habit of writing horrible lies about people. But — it must’ve been an accident, mustn’t it? He didn’t refuse! HARRY! Ron, he’s here, Harry’s here! We didn’t hear you arrive! Oh, how are you? Are you all right? Have you been furious with us? He seemed to think it was best, Dumbledore, I mean. He was so angry, Dumbledore. We saw him. When he found out Mundungus had left before his shift had ended. He was scary. Aren’t you . . . aren’t you worried about the Ministry of Magic hearing? I thought that too. But he didn’t want you to know anything. Of course he doesn’t think that! Harry, we wanted to tell you, we really did — Well, he did — We wanted to — No, honest — Harry, we’re really sorry! You’re absolutely right, Harry — I’d be furious if it was me! It’s a secret society, Dumbledore’s in charge, he founded it. It’s the people who fought against You-Know-Who last time. Quite a few people — — some of them are working on recruiting more people to the Order — We have, We’ve been decontaminating this house, it’s been empty for ages and stuff’s been breeding in here. We’ve managed to clean out the kitchen, most of the bedrooms, and I think we’re doing the drawing room tomo — AARGH! Stop doing that! He’s on our side now, Percy takes the Daily Prophet seriously, Haven’t — haven’t you been getting the Daily Prophet? Have you — er — been reading it thoroughly? Well, you’d need to read it cover to cover to pick it up, but they — um — they mention you a couple of times a week. Not if you’ve only been reading the front page, you wouldn’t, I’m not talking about big articles. They just slip you in, like you’re a standing joke. It’s quite nasty, actually, They’re just building on Rita’s stuff. Oh no, she’s kept her promise — not that she’s got any choice, But she laid the foundation for what they’re trying to do now. Okay, you know she wrote that you were collapsing all over the place and saying your scar was hurting and all that? Well, they’re writing about you as though you’re this deluded, attention-seeking person who thinks he’s a great tragic hero or something, They keep slipping in snide comments about you. I know, I know, Harry. But you see what they’re doing? They want to turn you into someone nobody will believe. Fudge is behind it, I’ll bet anything. They want wizards on the street to think you’re just some stupid boy who’s a bit of a joke, who tells ridiculous tall stories because he loves being famous and wants to keep it going. And of course, they didn’t report a word about the dementors attacking you, “We knew you’d be angry, Harry, we really don’t blame you, but you’ve got to understand, we did try and persuade Dumble-dore —” He’s not a nutter, Ron — Well — well, if he is a bit strange, it’s not his fault — It’s not ‘spew’! And don’t forget to keep your voice down in the hall, Harry, Do that one like a pig snout, Tonks . . . Kreacher’s really old, he probably couldn’t manage — Mundungus! What’s he brought all those cauldrons for? Kreacher, Harry Potter. It doesn’t matter, he’s not in his right mind, he doesn’t know what he’s — Sirius, he’s not right in the head, I don’t think he realizes we can hear him. If you just set him free, They were bound to clear you, There was no case against you, none at all . . . What’s up? Don’t you go feeling guilty! You belong at Hogwarts and Sirius knows it. Personally, I think he’s being selfish. He’ll have company! It’s headquarters to the Order of the Phoenix, isn’t it? He just got his hopes up that Harry would be coming to live here with him. He just didn’t want to get his own hopes up even more, And he probably felt a bit guilty himself, because I think a part of him was really hoping you’d be expelled. Then you’d both be outcasts together. Suit yourselves. But I sometimes think Ron’s mum’s right, and Sirius gets confused about whether you’re you or your father, Harry. No, I just think he’s been very lonely for a long time, Yeah, You know, maybe it wouldn’t be a bad idea to show people exactly how horrible it is to clean all the time — we could do a sponsored scrub of Gryffindor common room, all proceeds to S.P. E.W., it would raise awareness as well as funds — Did you — did you get — ? I knew it! Me too, Harry, me too! What? Ron? But . . . are you sure? I mean — I . . . I . . . well . . . wow! Well done, Ron! That’s really — No, no, it’s not . . . Ron’s done loads of . . . he’s really . . . He could if you don’t watch out! Those two! Don’t pay any attention to them, Ron, they’re only jealous! Harry? Thanks, They’ll be really pleased — I mean, prefect is something they can understand — Mrs. Weasley’s patched her up, But now Mad-Eye’s complaining that we can’t leave unless Sturgis Podmore’s here, otherwise the guard will be one short. You have to go to King’s Cross with a guard, I don’t know, it’s just what Mad-Eye says, But if we don’t leave soon we’re definitely going to miss the train . . . He shouldn’t have come with us, We’re — well — Ron and I are supposed to go into the prefect carriage, I don’t think we’ll have to stay there all journey, Our letters said we just get instructions from the Head Boy and Girl and then patrol the corridors from time to time. Well, there are two fifth-year prefects from each House, Boy and girl from each. And that complete cow Pansy Parkinson, How she got to be a prefect when she’s thicker than a concussed troll . . . And Anthony Goldstein and Padma Patil for Ravenclaw, You’re not supposed to abuse your position, Ron! So you’re going to descend to his level? For heaven’s sake, Ron — Of course not, The Quibbler’s rubbish, everyone knows that. I — oh, Well . . . it’s got some interesting . . . I mean, it’s quite . . . Malfoy, Get out! We’d better change, Come on, Come on, let’s get a carriage together before they all fill up . . . You don’t think he’s . . . hurt, or anything, do you? But where is he, then? Who’s that? Who? She works for Fudge? What on earth’s she doing here, then? No, no, surely not . . . I wonder if it’s ever given warnings before? What were you saying before the Sorting? About the hat giving warnings? Nick, he wasn’t really laughing at you! Well done, Ron, Oh forget it, Yes, it certainly was illuminating, I said illuminating, not enjoyable, It explained a lot. There was some important stuff hidden in the waffle, How about ‘progress for progress’s sake must be discouraged’? How about ‘pruning wherever we find practices that ought to be prohibited’? I’ll tell you what it means, It means the Ministry’s interfering at Hogwarts. Ron, we’re supposed to show the first years where to go! Well done, Ron, I know, but you can’t call them midgets. . . . First years! This way, please! It’s best to know what the enemy are saying, Nothing, Nothing about you or Dumbledore or anything. And speaking of your Skiving Snackboxes, you can’t advertise for testers on the Gryffindor notice board. Says me, And Ron. And why would starting fifth year mean I want a Skiving Snackbox? So? But where are you going to get the gold to start a joke shop? You’re going to need all the ingredients and materials — and premises too, I suppose . . . What did that mean? ‘Ask us no questions . . . ’ Does that mean they’ve already got some gold to start a joke shop? I don’t know, I think I’d really like to do something worthwhile. Yes, it is, but it’s not the only worthwhile thing, I mean, if I could take S.P. E.W. further . . . if I refused to lend you my notes this year? Well, you’d deserve it, You don’t even try to listen to him, do you? Oh, don’t give me that rubbish, You are so tactless! Couldn’t you tell she wanted to talk to Harry on her own? What on earth were you attacking her about her Quidditch team for? Attacking? Oh, come on, half the people you see wearing those badges only bought them last season — It means they’re not real fans, they’re just jumping on the bandwagon — That was really unfair, Your potion wasn’t nearly as bad as Goyle’s, when he put it in his flagon the whole thing shattered and set his robes on fire. I did think he might be a bit better this year, I mean . . . you know . . . . . . Now he’s in the Order and everything. I think Dumbledore’s probably got plenty of evidence, even if he doesn’t share it with you, Ron, Not about the chapter, no, I’ve got a query about your course aims, Hermione Granger, Well, I don’t, There’s nothing written up there about using defensive spells. Defense Against the Dark Arts Surely the whole point of Defense Against the Dark Arts is to practice defensive spells? No, No, Harry, no! How can Dumbledore have let this happen? And in our O.W.L. year too! Yes, but to employ someone who’s actually refusing to let us do magic! What’s Dumbledore playing at? Of course she’s here to spy on us all, that’s obvious, why else would Fudge have wanted her to come? No, I’m sorry, they’ve gone too far, Come on, Ron. You know perfectly well that those are bits of Nosebleed Nougat or — or Puking Pastilles or — That’s enough! I told you this morning, you can’t test your rubbish on students! I don’t care, it could be dangerous! It is NOT excellent! You can’t do this, what if you made one of them really ill? If you don’t stop doing it, I’m going to — No, but I will write to your mother. Oh, yes, I would, I can’t stop you eating the stupid things yourselves, but you’re not giving them to first years. Thank you for your support, Ron, Oh, it’s no good, I can’t concentrate now. I’m going to bed. They’re hats for house-elves, I did them over the summer. I’m a really slow knitter without magic, but now I’m back at school I should be able to make lots more. Yes, Of course they want to be free! Don’t you dare touch those hats, Ron! They’re tree-guardians, usually live in wand-trees. Wood lice, But fairy eggs if they can get them. Dumbledore would know if something had happened to Hagrid, It’s just playing into Malfoy’s hands to look worried, it tells him we don’t know exactly what’s going on. We’ve got to ignore him, Harry. Here, hold the bowtruckle for a moment, just so I can draw its face . . . I wasn’t going to, Well, they were right, weren’t they? There weren’t any such things as the Blibbering Humdinger or the Crumple-Horned Snorkack. Oh, for heaven’s sake, Harry, you can do better than her, Well, I wouldn’t expect anything else from someone whose father runs The Quibbler. What’s that got to do with our homework? At least it’s only lines, It’s not as if it’s a dreadful punishment, really . . . Well, why didn’t you do any last night? Where were you anyway? Oh, Harry, it’s you. . . . Good about Ron, isn’t it? They’re disappearing like mad! You’re worried that You-Know-Who’s controlling her like he controlled Quirrell? I suppose so, He could have her under the Imperius Curse, I suppose . . . But last year your scar hurt when nobody was touching you, and didn’t Dumbledore say it had to do with what You-Know-Who was feeling at the time? I mean, maybe this hasn’t got anything to do with Umbridge at all, maybe it’s just coincidence it happened while you were with her? Yes, Harry, I’m sure Dumbledore would want to be bothered by this — Don’t say that, it’s not true! Harry, you can’t put something like that in a letter! Don’t you remember, Moody told us to be careful what we put in writing! We just can’t guarantee owls aren’t being intercepted anymore! No, Look, I don’t think you should, No, just some guff about the bass player in the Weird Sisters getting married . . . Wait a moment, Oh no . . . Sirius! ‘The Ministry of Magic has received a tip-off from a reliable source that Sirius Black, notorious mass murderer . . . blah blah blah . . . is currently hiding in London!’ . . . ‘Ministry warns Wizarding community that Black is very dangerous . . . killed thirteen people . . . broke out of Azkaban . . .’ Shh! Well, maybe they didn’t expect him to get caught, Do you know, I wouldn’t be at all surprised if that were true. Right, well, I think we should tackle that essay for Sprout on Self-Fertilizing Shrubs first, and if we’re lucky we’ll be able to start McGonagall’s Inanimatus Conjurus before lunch . . . How was practice? Well, it was only your first one, No one, No, of course I didn’t! Look, you said it was lousy so I just — Was he lousy? Nearly done? Jupiter’s biggest moon is Ganymede, not Callisto, and it’s Io that’s got the volcanos. Sorry, I only — Ron — No — look! Isn’t that Hermes? Open it! Oh, give them here, Give them to me, I’ll look through them and correct them, Okay, write that down, and then copy out this conclusion that I’ve written for you. Harry Sirius’s head? You mean like when he wanted to talk to you during the Triwizard Tournament? But he wouldn’t do that now, it would be too — Sirius! But what if you’d been seen? But Sirius, this is taking an awful risk — You didn’t say you’d written to Sirius! We’ll tell you afterward, go on, Sirius. What’s she got against werewolves? Sirius! So we’re being prevented from learning Defense Against the Dark Arts because Fudge is scared we’ll use spells against the Ministry? But if he was supposed to be back by now . . . Yeah, Sirius, didn’t you see the Daily Prophet? Wait, there’s more, So now we know how we ended up with Umbridge! Fudge passed this ‘Educational Decree’ and forced her on us! And now he’s given her the power to inspect other teachers! I can’t believe this. It’s outrageous . . . Well, come on, we’d better get going, if she’s inspecting Binns’s class we don’t want to be late . . . I’ve already read chapter two, I’ve read that too. I’ve read the whole book. He says that counterjinxes are improperly named, He says ‘counterjinx’ is just a name people give their jinxes when they want to make them sound more acceptable. But I disagree, Yes, I do, Mr. Slinkhard doesn’t like jinxes, does he? But I think they can be very useful when they’re used defensively. I — but — but . . . wait! Don’t you get involved! I wish she hadn’t taken points from you, but I think she’s right to warn you not to lose your temper with Umbridge, Here, soak your hand in that, it’s a solution of strained and pickled murtlap tentacles, it should help. She’s an awful woman, No . . . I mean, something about what a dreadful teacher she is, and how we’re not going to learn any defense from her at all, Well, You know, I was thinking today . . . I was thinking that — maybe the time’s come when we should just — just do it ourselves. Well — learn Defense Against the Dark Arts ourselves, But this is much more important than homework! Don’t be silly, of course there is! It’s about preparing ourselves, like Harry said in Umbridge’s first lesson, for what’s waiting out there. It’s about making sure we really can defend ourselves. If we don’t learn anything for a whole year — No, I agree, we’ve gone past the stage where we can just learn things out of books, We need a teacher, a proper one, who can show us how to use the spells and correct us if we’re going wrong. No, no, I’m not talking about Lupin, He’s too busy with the Order and anyway, the most we could see him is during Hogsmeade weekends and that’s not nearly often enough. Isn’t it obvious? I’m talking about you, Harry. I’m talking about you teaching us Defense Against the Dark Arts. Harry, you’re the best in the year at Defense Against the Dark Arts, Actually, I haven’t, You beat me in our third year — the only year we both sat the test and had a teacher who actually knew the subject. But I’m not talking about test results, Harry. Look what you’ve done! Harry, don’t you see?   This . . . this is exactly why we need you. . . We need to know what it’s r-really like . . . facing him . . . facing V-Voldemort. “Well … I was wondering, whether you’d thought any more about Defense Against the Dark Arts, Harry. And? Yes, Harry, but all the same, there’s no point pretending that you’re not good at Defense Against the Dark Arts, because you are. You were the only person last year who could throw off the Imperius Curse completely, you can produce a Patronus, you can do all sorts of stuff that full-grown wizards can’t, Viktor always said — Ho ho, He said Harry knew how to do stuff even he didn’t, and he was in the final year at Durmstrang. So what if I am? Well, what do you think? Will you teach us? Well, Well, I think you might be surprised how many people would be interested in hearing what you’ve got to say, Look, you know the first weekend in October’s a Hogsmeade weekend? How would it be if we tell anyone who’s interested to meet us in the village and we can talk it over? Because, I don’t think Umbridge would be very happy if she found out what we were up to. The trouble is, until V-Voldemort — oh for heaven’s sake, Ron — comes out into the open, Sirius is going to have to stay hidden, isn’t he? I mean, the stupid Ministry isn’t going to realize Sirius is innocent until they accept that Dumbledore’s been telling the truth about him all along. And once the fools start catching real Death Eaters again it’ll be obvious Sirius isn’t one . . . I mean, he hasn’t got the Mark, for one thing. Listen, Ron and I have been sounding out people who we thought might want to learn some proper Defense Against the Dark Arts, and there are a couple who seem interested. We’ve told them to meet us in Hogsmeade. Don’t worry, Harry, You’ve got enough on your plate without Sirius too. He said he was tipped off you were ordering Dungbombs? But who had tipped him off? Malfoy? Well . . . yes . . . maybe . . . Oh — no, no, it’s always packed and really noisy. I’ve told the others to meet us in the Hog’s Head, that other pub, you know the one, it’s not on the main road. I think it’s a bit . . . you know . . . dodgy . . . but students don’t normally go in there, so I don’t think we’ll be overheard. Well, come on, Umbridge is shorter than that woman, And anyway, even if Umbridge does come in here there’s nothing she can do to stop us, Harry, because I’ve double- and triple-checked the school rules. We’re not out-of-bounds; I specifically asked Professor Flitwick whether students were allowed to come in the Hog’s Head, and he said yes, but he advised me strongly to bring our own glasses. And I’ve looked up everything I can think of about study groups and homework groups and they’re definitely allowed. I just don’t think it’s a good idea if we parade what we’re doing. Three butterbeers, please, You — are — a — prefect, Just a couple of people, I told them to be here about now and I’m sure they all know where it is — oh look, this might be them now — Yes, well, the idea seemed quite popular, Ron, do you want to pull up some more chairs? I’ve told you, they just want to hear what you’ve got to say, You don’t have to do anything yet, I’ll speak to them first. Well, Well — er — hi. Well, Erm . . . well, Harry here had the idea — I mean I had the idea — that it might be good if people who wanted to study Defense Against the Dark Arts — and I mean, really study it, you know, not the rubbish that Umbridge is doing with us And by that I mean learning how to defend ourselves properly, not just theory but the real spells — Of course I do, But I want more than that, I want to be properly trained in Defense because . . . because . . . Because Lord Voldemort’s back. Well . . . that’s the plan anyway, If you want to join us, we need to decide how we’re going to — Oh, Look, So, So . . . like I was saying . . . if you want to learn some defense, then we need to work out how we’re going to do it, how often we’re going to meet, and where we’re going to — Sorcerer’s, Yes, well, moving on . . . the point is, are we agreed we want to take lessons from Harry? The trouble is, Well, then, the next question is how often we do it. I really don’t think there’s any point in meeting less than once a week — I’m sure we can find a night that suits everyone, but you know, this is rather important, we’re talking about learning to defend ourselves against V-Voldemort’s Death Eaters — We think the reason Umbridge doesn’t want us trained in Defense Against the Dark Arts, is that she’s got some . . . some mad idea that Dumbledore could use the students in the school as a kind of private army. She thinks he’d mobilize us against the Ministry. No, he hasn’t, They don’t exist, Neville, I’m sorry, but where’s the proof of that? No, yes, we were, you’re right . . . No, Well, the other thing to decide is where we’re going to meet . . . Right, well, we’ll try to find somewhere, We’ll send a message round to everybody when we’ve got a time and a place for the first meeting. I-I think everybody should write their name down, just so we know who was here. But I also think, that we all ought to agree not to shout about what we’re doing. So if you sign, you’re agreeing not to tell Umbridge — or anybody else — what we’re up to. Ernie, do you really think I’d leave that list lying around? Well, it’s an old-fashioned rule, but it says in Hogwarts: A History that the founders thought boys were less trustworthy than girls. Anyway, why were you trying to get in there? She can’t, Me, Believe me, if anyone’s run off and told Umbridge, we’ll know exactly who they are and they will really regret it. Well, put it this way, it’ll make Eloise Midgen’s acne look like a couple of cute freckles.  Come on, let’s get down to breakfast and see what the others think. . . . I wonder whether this has been put up in all the Houses? Of course, Never mind spots, the idiots can’t come over here now, it’ll look really suspicious — sit down! Later! We’ll — talk — to — you — later! Look — there’s something wrong with her wing — Is Hedwig okay? Well, I was just saying to Ron . . . what if someone had tried to intercept Hedwig? I mean, she’s never been hurt on a flight before, has she? Obviously, I just hope nobody else has read this . . . I don’t know, It wouldn’t be exactly difficult to reseal the scroll by magic. . . . And if anyone’s watching the Floo Network . . . but I don’t really see how we can warn him not to come without that being intercepted too! Don’t rise, It’s what he wants . . . Harry! Not pomegranate juice! You can’t skive off Divination, I don’t hate her, I just think she’s an absolutely appalling teacher and a real old fraud. . . . But Harry’s already missed History of Magic and I don’t think he ought to miss anything else today! Well, look on the bright side — at least now you’ll have time to do Snape’s essay! I can’t, they’re not technically doing anything wrong, They’re quite within their rights to eat the foul things themselves, and I can’t find a rule that says the other idiots aren’t entitled to buy them, not unless they’re proven to be dangerous in some way, and it doesn’t look as though they are . . . Oh, they only know flashy stuff that’s no real use to anyone, Well, it was better than the Three Broomsticks! Who overheard us? And if we do get expelled? I know it was. . . . I just wondered what Sirius thought, Well, Sirius, it’s just that there were only four of you meeting in the Shrieking Shack when you were at school, and all of you could transform into animals and I suppose you could all have squeezed under a single Invisibility Cloak if you’d wanted to. But there are twenty-eight of us and none of us is an Animagus, so we wouldn’t need so much an Invisibility Cloak as an Invisibility Marquee — “Umbridge has been reading your mail, Harry. There’s no other explanation.” I’ve been suspecting this ever since Filch accused you of ordering Dungbombs, because it seemed such a stupid lie, I mean, once your letter had been read, it would have been quite clear you weren’t ordering them, so you wouldn’t have been in trouble at all — it’s a bit of a feeble joke, isn’t it? But then I thought, what if somebody just wanted an excuse to read your mail? Well then, it would be a perfect way for Umbridge to manage it — tip off Filch, let him do the dirty work and confiscate the letter, then either find a way of stealing it from him or else demand to see it — I don’t think Filch would object, when’s he ever stuck up for a student’s rights? Harry, you’re squashing your frog. It was a very, very close call last night, I just wonder if Umbridge knows how close it was. Silencio! Silencio! SILENCIO! Silencio! Well, he mustn’t do it again, that’s all. I just don’t know how we’re going to let him know. We can’t send him an owl. Silencio! SILENCIO! It’s the way you’re moving your wand, You don’t want to wave it, it’s more a sharp jab. Silencio! Silencio! SILENCIO! Silencio! Just thinking . . . No . . . not exactly . . . More . . . wondering . . . I suppose we’re doing the right thing . . . I think . . . aren’t we? I was just wondering, whether we’re doing the right thing, starting this Defense Against the Dark Arts group. I know, But after talking to Snuffles . . . Yes, Yes, that’s what made me think maybe it wasn’t a good idea after all . . . Do you honestly trust his judgment? You don’t think he has become . . . sort of . . . reckless . . . since he’s been cooped up in Grimmauld Place? You don’t think he’s . . . kind of . . . living through us? I mean . . . well, I think he’d love to be forming secret defense societies right under the nose of someone from the Ministry. . . . I think he’s really frustrated at how little he can do where he is . . . so I think he’s keen to kind of . . . egg us on. Well . . . it’s just that Dobby’s plans aren’t always that safe. Don’t you remember when he lost you all the bones in your arm? Dumbledore told you about it? Oh well, that’s all right then, And Umbridge? Harry And just look at these books! A Compendium of Common Curses and Their Counter-Actions . . . The Dark Arts Outsmarted . . . Self-Defensive Spellwork . . . wow . . . Harry, this is wonderful, there’s everything we need here! I think we ought to elect a leader, Yes, but I think we ought to vote on it properly, It makes it formal and it gives him authority. So — everyone who thinks Harry ought to be our leader? I also think we ought to have a name, It would promote a feeling of team spirit and unity, don’t you think? I was thinking, more of a name that didn’t tell everyone what we were up to, so we can refer to it safely outside meetings. All in favor of the D. A.? That’s a majority — motion passed! Right, shall we get practicing then? I was thinking, the first thing we should do is Expelliarmus, you know, the Disarming Charm. I know it’s pretty basic but I’ve found it really useful — Hey, Harry, have you checked the time? Harry, “Only once,” “Well, if you’re counting the one where you tripped over your own feet and knocked the wand out of my hand —” You see the numerals around the edge of the coins? On real Galleons that’s just a serial number referring to the goblin who cast the coin. On these fake coins, though, the numbers will change to reflect the time and date of the next meeting. The coins will grow hot when the date changes, so if you’re carrying them in a pocket you’ll be able to feel them. We take one each, and when Harry sets the date of the next meeting he’ll change the numbers on his coin, and because I’ve put a Protean Charm on them, they’ll all change to mimic his. Well — I thought it was a good idea, I mean, even if Umbridge asked us to turn out our pockets, there’s nothing fishy about carrying a Galleon, is there? But . . . well, if you don’t want to use them . . . Yes, Oh, Oh . . . well . . . yes, I suppose it is . . . Well, the Sorting Hat did seriously consider putting me in Ravenclaw during my Sorting, but it decided on Gryffindor in the end. So does that mean we’re using the Galleons? No, what’s that? Well . . . yes, That is where I got the idea . . . but you’ll notice I decided to engrave the date on bits of metal rather than on our members’ skin . . . Well, that’s a good sign, I never feel you perform as well in exams if you’re not a bit nervous, Don’t let Ron see what’s on those Slytherins’ badges, Good luck, Ron, And you, Harry — Have you seen Ron? Where have you been? You look frozen, Come and sit down! Well, I can think of one thing that might cheer you both up. Yeah, Hagrid’s back. I’m sorry! I just — oh, Hagrid! You ought to go and see Madam Pomfrey, Hagrid, Some of those cuts look nasty. Did the giants beat you up, Hagrid? We guessed, And you found them? Didn’t you know? Madame Maxime went with you, then? I’ve been there on holiday, did you see — ? Is that all? And you just walked up to him? Everlasting fire, you ought to know that by now, Professor Flitwick’s mentioned it at least twice in class! Why couldn’t you speak to them that day? And you talked to him? WHAT? But that night it all wen’ wrong. Whose head? So how come it’s taken you so long to get home if you were only there for three days? But you’ve just said there was no way you could go back! Did he rip off more heads? What d’you mean? So Macnair’s persuaded the giants to join You-Know-Who? Didn’t they attack you when they saw you?  Hagrid? Did you . . . was there any sign of . . . did you hear anything about your . . . your . . . mother while you were there? I’m sorry . . . I . . . forget it — Oh . . . I’m . . . I’m really sorry, Not yet, She might not be gone yet. WHAT? Erm . . . special in what way? Not yet, Hagrid . . . please . . . Umbridge is looking for any excuse to get rid of teachers she thinks are too close to Dumbledore. Please, Hagrid, teach us something dull that’s bound to come up in our O. W.L . . . So? Got all his lessons planned for him? Well, I tried, He wasn’t even there when I arrived, I was knocking for at least half an hour. And then he came stumping out of the forest — No, He says he wants them to be a surprise. I tried to explain about Umbridge, but he just doesn’t get it. but that’s not for lack of trying from what he said about how hard it is to get eggs. . . . I don’t know how many times I told him he’d be better off following Grubbly-Plank’s plan,  I honestly don’t think he listened to half of what I said. He’s in a bit of a funny mood, you know. He still won’t say how he got all those injuries . . . oh! The only people who can see thestrals,  are people who have seen death You hag, you evil hag! I know what you’re doing, you awful, twisted, vicious — That foul, lying, twisting old gargoyle! You see what she’s up to? It’s her thing about half-breeds all over again — she’s trying to make out Hagrid’s some kind of dim-witted troll, just because he had a giantess for a mother — and oh, it’s not fair, that really wasn’t a bad lesson at all — I mean, all right, if it had been Blast-Ended Skrewts again, but thestrals are fine — in fact, for Hagrid, they’re really good! Well, it’s like Hagrid said, they can look after themselves, and I suppose a teacher like Grubbly-Plank wouldn’t usually show them to us before N. E.W.T. level, but, well, they are very interesting, aren’t they? The way some people can see them and some can’t! I wish I could. Oh Harry — I’m sorry — no, of course I don’t — that was a really stupid thing to say — Ignore them, just ignore them, Are you all right, Harry? Is it Cho? Did she corner you after the meeting? Did you kiss? Of course you’re not, Because Cho spends half her time crying these days, She does it at mealtimes, in the loos, all over the place. Ron, you are the most insensitive wart I have ever had the misfortune to meet. Don’t you understand how Cho’s feeling at the moment? Oh, Then I expect she’s feeling confused because she liked Cedric and now she likes Harry, and she can’t work out who she likes best. Oh, and she’s afraid she’s going to be thrown off the Ravenclaw Quidditch team because she’s been flying so badly. Just because you’ve got the emotional range of a teaspoon doesn’t mean we all have, You just had to be nice to her, You were, weren’t you? Well, I suppose it could have been worse, Are you going to see her again? You know what I mean, Oh well, you’ll have plenty of opportunities to ask her . . . Don’t be silly, Harry’s liked her for ages, haven’t you, Harry? Viktor. How many other Viktors do we know? Well, ’night, ’Night, I know you’re in there, Will you please come out? I want to talk to you. I came on the Knight Bus, Umbridge is already livid that you lot disappeared right under her nose, even though Dumbledore told her Mr. Weasley was in St. Mungo’s, and he’d given you all permission to visit. So . . . How’re you feeling? Harry, Ron and Ginny say you’ve been hiding from everyone since you got back from St. Mungo’s. Maybe you’re taking it in turns to look and keep missing each other, Oh, stop feeling all misunderstood, the others have told me what you overheard last night on the Extendable Ears — Harry, You had flashes of what Voldemort was up to last year. One day,you’ll read Hogwarts: A History,  and perhaps that will remind you that you can’t Apparate or Disapparate inside Hogwarts. Even Voldemort couldn’t just make you fly out of your dormitory, Harry. Kreacher, It isn’t clothes, although if I had my way I’d certainly give him something to wear other than that filthy old rag. No, it’s a patchwork quilt, I thought it would brighten up his bedroom. Well, Sirius says it’s not so much a bedroom, more a kind of — den, Apparently he sleeps under the boiler in that cupboard off the kitchen. Yes, Er . . . I think we’d better knock . . . I think I’ll just leave his present here, He’ll find it later, that’ll be fine . . . Well, you know, they do work well on non-magical wounds, I suppose something in that snake’s venom dissolves them or something. . . . I wonder where the tearoom is? Fifth floor, Oh my goodness, Professor Lockhart! We’ll be in the library, Harry, How did it go? Are you all right, Harry? Of course, Ron, think about it. . . . Sturgis Podmore was trying to get through a door at the Ministry of Magic. . . . It must have been that one, it’s too much of a coincidence! Oh, That is a bit odd . . . It’s not weird at all, it makes perfect sense, It will be something top secret that the Ministry has been developing, I expect. . . . Harry, are you sure you’re all right? I expect anyone would feel shaky if they’d had their mind attacked over and over again, Look, let’s get back to the common room, we’ll be a bit more comfortable there . . . How do those hats work, then? I mean, obviously it’s some kind of Invisibility Spell, but it’s rather clever to have extended the field of invisibility beyond the boundaries of the charmed object. . . . I’d imagine the charm wouldn’t have a very long life though . . . Well, write it in your homework planner then! So you don’t forget! Shhh! Not so loud — just read it! What other options does he have? ’ I mean, he’s spent a good six months telling everyone you and Dumbledore are liars, hasn’t he? Oh my — It’s . . . horrible, We saw him, In St. Mungo’s, remember? He was in the bed opposite Lockhart’s, just lying there, staring at the ceiling. And we saw the Devil’s Snare arrive. She — the Healer — said it was a Christmas present . . . Oh come on, Ron! I don’t think anyone could put Devil’s Snare in a pot and not realize it tries to kill whoever touches it?   This — this was murder. . . A clever murder, as well. . . . If the plant was sent anonymously, how’s anyone ever going to find out who did it? To send a letter, It . . . well, I don’t know whether . . . but it’s worth trying . . . and I’m the only one who can . . . They obviously can’t talk freely in the staffroom anymore, Not with Umbridge there. Maybe it’s a bit like an illness, A fever or something. It has to get worse before it gets better. That’s not funny, Dumbledore doesn’t want you to have dreams about that corridor at all, or he wouldn’t have asked Snape to teach you Occlumency. You’re just going to have to work a bit harder in your lessons. Maybe what? What do you mean? Shut up, Ron, How many times have you suspected Snape, and when have you ever been right? Dumbledore trusts him, he works for the Order, that ought to be enough. Dumbledore trusts him, And if we can’t trust Dumbledore, we can’t trust anyone. And about time! If it hadn’t come today . . . Harry, This is really important. . . . Do you think you could meet me in the Three Broomsticks around midday? Well, bring her along if you must, But will you come? I haven’t got time to tell you now, I’ve got to answer this quickly — Harry, Harry, over here! You’re early! I thought you were with Cho, I wasn’t expecting you for another hour at least! It’s none of your business if Harry’s been with a hundred girls, So you can put that away right now. Yes, One more word about Harry’s love life and the deal’s off and that’s a promise, Listen, Harry, Find someone who cares, why don’t you? He feels angry, of course, Because he’s told the Minister of Magic the truth and the Minister’s too much of an idiot to believe him. As a matter of fact, that’s exactly what Little Miss Perfect does want. Yeah, The true story. All the facts. Exactly as Harry reports them. He’ll give you all the details, he’ll tell you the names of the undiscovered Death Eaters he saw there, he’ll tell you what Voldemort looks like now — oh, get a grip on yourself, We don’t need another story about how Harry’s lost his marbles! We’ve had plenty of those already, thank you! I want him given the opportunity to tell the truth! You mean the Prophet won’t print it because Fudge won’t let them, So the Daily Prophet exists to tell people what they want to hear, does it? Well, this is your chance to raise the tone of it a bit, isn’t it? Luna says her father’s quite happy to take Harry’s interview. That’s who’ll be publishing it. Some people won’t, But the Daily Prophet’s version of the Azkaban breakout had some gaping holes in it. I think a lot of people will be wondering whether there isn’t a better explanation of what happened, and if there’s an alternative story available, even if it is published in a in a — well, an unusual magazine — I think they might be rather keen to read it. But of course, Otherwise, as you very well know, I will inform the authorities that you are an unregistered Animagus. Of course, the Prophet might give you rather a lot for an insider’s account of life in Azkaban . . . Harry, Ready to tell the public the truth? “Fire away, then, Rita,” Oh, I forgot to ask you, what happened on your date with Cho? How come you were back so early? Oh, Harry, Well, I’m sorry, but you were a bit tactless. Well, you see, you shouldn’t have told her that you wanted to meet me halfway through your date. You should have told her differently, You should have said it was really annoying, but I’d made you promise to come along to the Three Broomsticks, and you really didn’t want to go, you’d much rather spend the whole day with her, but unfortunately you thought you really ought to meet me and would she please, please come along with you, and hopefully you’d be able to get away more quickly? And it might have been a good idea to mention how ugly you think I am too, Harry, you’re worse than Ron. . . . Well, no, you’re not, Look — you upset Cho when you said you were going to meet me, so she tried to make you jealous. It was her way of trying to find out how much you liked her. Girls don’t often ask questions like that, I’m not saying what she did was sensible, I’m just trying to make you see how she was feeling at the time. Oh come on, She’s been breaking into your broom shed in the garden since the age of six and taking each of your brooms out in turn when you weren’t looking, Has Ron saved a goal yet? You’ve got exams coming! That’s the trouble with Quidditch, it creates all this bad feeling and tension between the Houses. Well, it does! It’s only a game, isn’t it? Maybe not, but at least my happiness doesn’t depend on Ron’s goalkeeping ability. Harry! I think I know what this means — open this one first! That’s what I thought, Harry, d’you mind if we — ? This woman recommends you try a good course of Shock Spells at St. Mungo’s, Harry! ‘Having read your side of the story I am forced to the conclusion that the Daily Prophet has treated you very unfairly. . . . Little though I want to think that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has returned, I am forced to accept that you are telling the truth . . .’ Oh this is wonderful! Oh Harry, don’t you see? If she could have done one thing to make absolutely sure that every single person in this school will read your interview, it was banning it! And then they spotted me, and obviously they know I know you, so they were bombarding me with questions, and Harry, I think they believe you, I really do, I think you’ve finally got them convinced! So that’s why they killed him, When Bode tried to steal this weapon, something funny happened to him. I think there must be defensive spells on it, or around it, to stop people from touching it. That’s why he was in St. Mungo’s, his brain had gone all funny and he couldn’t talk. But remember what the Healer told us? He was recovering. And they couldn’t risk him getting better, could they? I mean, the shock of whatever happened when he touched that weapon probably made the Imperius Curse lift. Once he’d got his voice back, he’d explain what he’d been doing, wouldn’t he? They would have known he’d been sent to steal the weapon. Of course, it would have been easy for Lucius Malfoy to put the curse on him. Never out of the Ministry, is he? Sturgis, Harry, Arrested for trying to get through a door. Lucius Malfoy got him too. I bet he did it the day you saw him there, Harry. Sturgis had Moody’s Invisibility Cloak, right? So what if he was standing guard by the door, invisible, and Malfoy heard him move, or guessed he was there, or just did the Imperius Curse on the off chance that a guard was there? So when Sturgis next had an opportunity — probably when it was his turn on guard duty again — he tried to get into the department to steal the weapon for Voldemort — Ron, be quiet — but he got caught and sent to Azkaban . . . And now Rookwood’s told Voldemort how to get the weapon? But you shouldn’t have seen this at all, Harry. You’re supposed to be learning how to close your mind to this sort of thing, Well, I think we should just try and forget what you saw, And you ought to put in a bit more effort on your Occlumency from now on. Not really, I’ve never really liked horses. Either way, he’s still got four legs, Anyway, I thought you two were all upset that Trelawney had gone? I’ve got a feeling Umbridge has only just started being horrible, You mark my words, she’s going to want revenge on Dumbledore for appointing a new teacher without consulting her, Especially another part-human. You saw the look on her face when she saw Firenze . . . They are sort of nice, aren’t they? Harry, come on! Oh, I expect she really fancied herself sitting up there in the Head’s office, Lording it over all the other teachers, the stupid puffed-up, power-crazy old — The what? The what? Don’t! But you’ll get into terrible trouble! Have you ever? You mustn’t! You really mustn’t! She’d love a reason to expel you! Anything to do with what? I think we should get out of here, you know, Just in case . . . But why haven’t you got Occlumency lessons anymore? So you’ve stopped having funny dreams? Well, I don’t think Snape should stop until you’re absolutely sure you can control them! Harry, I think you should go back to him and ask — No, How can that come as a shock? Well, there you are, if you follow that you should do fine. That’s for Quidditch practice, What’s wrong, Harry? I saw Cho earlier, and she looked really miserable too. . . . Have you two had a row again? What about? Well, it’s a very responsible job, isn’t it? You don’t seem to need many qualifications to liaise with Muggles. . . . All they want is an O. W.L. in Muggle Studies . . . ‘Much more important is your enthusiasm, patience, and a good sense of fun! ’ What? Don’t be so ridiculous, With Umbridge groping around in the fires and frisking all the owls? Yes, but still, even if you do cause a diversion, how is Harry supposed to talk to him? Are — you — insane? And how are you going to get in there in the first place? Excuse me? What do you think about this? Should we say something? About what happened to him? In case it helps Madam Pomfrey cure him? Reparo! That’s all very well, but what if Montague’s permanently injured? You? Why should I be worried about you? But — Well, if she does say that it’ll be very unfair, you couldn’t have done anything! But I’m sure she won’t, I mean, if it’s really true they’ve got premises in Diagon Alley now, they must have been planning this for ages . . . Well, yes, that occurred to me too, I’ve been wondering whether Mundungus has persuaded them to sell stolen goods or something awful . . . Oh, Harry, you didn’t! I wasn’t going to say anything about Fred and George! No, I wasn’t! As a matter of fact, I was going to ask Harry when he’s going to go back to Snape and ask for Occlumency lessons again! You can’t tell me you’ve stopped having funny dreams, because Ron told me last night you were muttering in your sleep again . . . You are trying to block your mind, aren’t you? You are keeping going with your Occlumency? What is it, Hagrid? Into the forest? You didn’t bring your crossbow the day you showed us the thestrals, Why does Firenze leaving make a difference? They attacked him? Is that why we’re here, Hagrid? The centaurs? Hagrid, would it be all right if we lit our wands? Good! Lumos! Hagrid, who is he? Hagrid, you told us none of them wanted to come! Hagrid? Why — what — oh, Hagrid! Harmless! Hagrid, Small? Small? Yeah, Absolutely minuscule! Hagrid, What do you think you’re going to do with a violent giant who doesn’t even want to be here! You have to keep him tied up? So what is it you want Harry and Ron and me to do? What — what does that involve, exactly? Hagrid, Hagrid, no, don’t wake him, really, we don’t need — Oh my . . . Hagrid, No, not at all, Hagrid, let’s go, please let’s go! Hagrid, if the centaurs don’t want humans in the forest, it doesn’t really look as though Harry and I will be able — I don’t know, I don’t believe him, I don’t believe him. I really don’t believe him . . . Calm down! A giant! A giant in the forest! And we’re supposed to give him English lessons! Always assuming, of course, we can get past the herd of murderous centaurs on the way in and out! I — don’t — believe — him! Oh come off it, Harry! Of course he’s going to be chucked out and to be perfectly honest, after what we’ve just seen, who can blame Umbridge? No . . . well . . . all right . . . I didn’t, But why does he have to make life so difficult for himself — for us? And I wish they’d stop singing that stupid song, haven’t they gloated enough? Oh, let’s get in before we have to meet the Slytherins, No! Righ’, I’m not in any hurry . . . Well, actually . . . no, Ron, As a matter of fact, the only bit of the match Harry and I saw was Davies’s first goal. Well — no, But Ron, we didn’t want to leave — we had to! Well, he has, Grawp’s about sixteen feet tall, enjoys ripping up twenty-foot pine trees, and knows me, as Hermy. And Hagrid wants us to . . . ? Yeah, Yes, Yes, I’m starting to think he has. But unfortunately, he made Harry and me promise. I know, it’s just that — we promised, Don’t be stupid, You might as well take Harold Dingle’s powdered dragon claw and have done with it. Not anymore, I confiscated that too. None of these things actually works you know — This stuff can, I’ve had a look at it, and it’s actually dried doxy droppings. Please, Professor, when will we find out our results? Only! I’ve got Arithmancy and it’s probably the toughest subject there is! Well, I think I’ve done all right in Arithmancy, Just time for a quick look over our star charts before dinner, then . . . Umbridge hates part-humans, She was always going to try and get Hagrid out. Harry! What happened? Are you all right? Are you ill? what What? How d’you — ? But — but where? How? Harry, er . . . how . . . how did Voldemort get into the Ministry of Magic without anybody realizing he was there? Harry, it’s five o’clock in the afternoon. . . . The Ministry of Magic must be full of workers. . . . How would Voldemort and Sirius have got in without being seen? Harry . . . they’re probably the two most wanted wizards in the world. . . . You think they could get into a building full of Aurors undetected? Harry, You’ve dreamed about the place, that’s all. Harry, Harry, how on earth could Voldemort have got hold of Sirius when he’s been in Grimmauld Place all the time? But why, why on earth would Voldemort want to use Sirius to get the weapon, or whatever the thing is? I dunno, there could be loads of reasons! Look, I’m sorry, but neither of you are making sense, and we’ve got no proof for any of this, no proof Voldemort and Sirius are even there — Right, Harry! But you do . . . sort of . . . I mean — don’t you think you’ve got a bit of a — a — saving-people-thing? Well . . . you . . . I mean . . . last year, for instance . . . in the lake . . . during the Tournament . . . you shouldn’t have . . . I mean, you didn’t need to save that little Delacour girl. . . . You got a bit . . . carried away . . . . . . I mean, it was really great of you and everything, No, no, no! That’s not what I mean at all! Harry! He took Ginny down into the Chamber of Secrets to lure you there, it’s the kind of thing he does, he knows you’re the — the sort of person who’d go to Sirius’s aid! What if he’s just trying to get you into the Department of Myst — ? But Harry — what if your dream was — was just that, a dream? Harry, Dumbledore wanted you to learn to shut these things out of your mind, if you’d done Occlumency properly you’d never have seen this — Sirius told you there was nothing more important than you learning to close your mind! Harry, Wait . . . Harry, they can help. Harry, Harry, we need to establish whether Sirius really has left headquarters — Harry, I’ll come, I’ll d-do whatever it takes to try and save him —” Harry, We’ll have to use Umbridge’s fire and see if we can contact him, We’ll draw Umbridge away again, but we’ll need lookouts, and that’s where we can use Ginny and Luna. Right, Right . . . well . . . One of us has to go and find Umbridge and — and send her off in the wrong direction, keep her away from her office. They could tell her — I don’t know — that Peeves is up to something awful as usual . . . Okay, Now, we need to keep students away from her office while we force entry, or some Slytherin’s bound to go and tip her off . . . Harry, well then, Harry, you and I will be under the Invisibility Cloak, and we’ll sneak into the office and you can talk to Sirius — Right, well, even if we do all of that, I don’t think we’re going to be able to bank on more than five minutes, not with Filch and the wretched Inquisitorial Squad floating around. Now? I — oh all right, You go and get the Invisibility Cloak and we’ll meet you at the end of Umbridge’s corridor, okay? Get over here, Are — are you sure you’re okay, Harry? You’re still very pale . . . I think that’s as good as we’re going to get, Harry — come on, let’s do it. Good one . . . don’t forget the signal . . . A loud chorus of ‘Weasley Is Our King’ if they see Umbridge coming, I thought she might have added extra security after the second niffler . . . NO! The Minister wouldn’t want you to break the law, Professor Umbridge! NO! No — Harry — Harry, we’ll have to tell her! Harry, I’m — I’m sorry everyone, Well, well, he was trying to speak to Professor Dumbledore . . . NO! But — but we needed to tell him something important! We . . . we wanted to tell him it’s r-ready! The . . . the weapon, Yes, But he had to leave before it was finished and n-n-now we’ve finished it for him, and we c-c-can’t find him t-t-to tell him! We don’t r-r-really understand it, We j-j-just did what P-P-Professor Dumbledore told us t-t-to do . . . I’m not showing . . . them, Right, fine . . . let them see it, I hope they use it on you! In fact, I wish you’d invite loads and loads of people to come and see! Th-that would serve you right — oh, I’d love it if the wh-whole school knew where it was, and how to u-use it, and then if you annoy any of them they’ll be able to s-sort you out! Of course not, Hagrid might have set it off accidentally. In there, of course, It had to be somewhere that students weren’t going to find it accidentally, didn’t it? Yes, Yes, it’s well hidden. Oh yes, I want us heard, You’ll see . . . Not far now! Don’t call them that! Be quiet! Please, please, don’t attack us, we don’t think like her, we aren’t Ministry of Magic employees! We only came in here because we hoped you’d drive her off for us — No! Please — I didn’t mean that! I just hoped you’d be able to — to help us — You said you didn’t hurt the innocent! We haven’t done anything to hurt you, we haven’t used wands or threats, we just want to go back to school, please let us go back — Harry! I think he’s trying to say ‘Hagrid’! he — he remembered! I don’t know! I’m sorry, Grawp, I don’t know! Goodness, Oh, that was horrible. And he might kill them all . . . We need to get back up to the castle, Well, we can’t do anything without wands, Anyway, Harry, how exactly were you planning to get all the way to London? Well, we need three, I’m not staying behind! Don’t go calling for him, though! No, Yes . . . I wonder what they’re doing with them? Wait! Flagrate! Careful! Let’s go, This isn’t right, Harry, come on, let’s go . . . Harry, let’s go, okay? Nobody’s talking, Harry! What do you mean, ‘in there’? There isn’t any ‘in there,’ it’s just an archway, there’s no room for anybody to be there — Harry, stop it, come away — Harry, we are supposed to be here for Sirius! That’s what I’ve been trying to — well, come on, then! I don’t know, but whatever it was, it was dangerous, What? Get out of the way! Alohomora! Right, we’re leaving that room, It can’t be, Harry could get through all the doors in his dream, Something blibbering, no doubt, You said it was row ninety-seven, We need to go right, I think, Yes . . . that’s fifty-four. . . . Ninety-seven! Harry? Harry? I . . . I don’t think Sirius is here. Harry, I don’t think you should touch it, What? What? What? What? STUPEFY! STUBEFY! They must have gone the wrong way! What do we do? Stupefy!  STUPEFY! STUBEFY! Accio Wand! It’s time, Time . . . Harry! You can’t hurt a baby! Collo — Silencio! Well done, Ha — There you are, Harry, I knew they’d drag you into it somehow, Yes, they’re very complimentary about you now, Harry, ‘A lone voice of truth . . . perceived as unbalanced, yet never wavered in his story . . . forced to bear ridicule and slander . . . ’ Hmmm, I notice they don’t mention the fact that it was them doing all the ridiculing and slandering, though . . . ‘You-Know-Who’s Last Attempt to Take Over, pages two to four,  Exclusive Interview with Harry Pot-ter, page nine … . .’ Well,’ it’s certainly given them lots to write about. And that interview with Harry isn’t exclusive, it’s the one that was in The Quibbler months ago . . . That sounds lovely. So anyway, what’s going on in school? Why? So has all the trouble stopped now Dumbledore’s back? Madam Pomfrey says she’s just in shock, Speaking of centaurs, who’s Divination teacher now? Is Firenze staying? How can you say that? After we’ve just found out that there are real prophecies? It is a pity it broke, Say hello to him for us! And ask him what’s happening about . . . about his little friend! It hasn’t really started yet, But it won’t be long now . . . I — er — heard she’s going out with someone else now, Ron, don’t hit him! Oh, I’m fine, No, of course not! So, um, did Slughorn seem like he’ll be a good teacher? What’s she done now? I know, She’s so full of herself. It’s pathetic, And she’s more intelligent, she’s an Auror! Not you as well! That’s not fair, She still hasn’t got over what happened . . . you know . . . I mean, he was her cousin! That’s not the point, She thinks it was her fault he died! Well, she was fighting Bellatrix Lestrange, wasn’t she? I think she feels that if only she had finished her off, Bellatrix couldn’t have killed Sirius. It’s survivor’s guilt, I know Lupin’s tried to talk her round, but she’s still really down. She’s actually having trouble with her Metamorphosing! She can’t change her appearance like she used to, I think her powers must have been affected by shock, or something. Nor did I, but I suppose if you’re really depressed . . . What’s this? said Dumbledore. I heard him telling your mum, Ron. Nobody knows what it said, though, It got smashed. Shh! I squeezed it and it — it punched me! Oh, Harry, oh, Harry . . . We wondered, after we got back from the Ministry . . . Obviously, we didn’t want to say anything to you, but from what Lucius Malfoy said about the prophecy, how it was about you and Voldemort, well, we thought it might be something like this. . . . Oh, Harry . . . Are you scared? That’s true, I wonder what he’ll teach you, Harry? Really advanced defensive magic, probably .powerful countercurses . . . anti-jinxes . . . . . . and evasive enchantments generally, Well, at least you know one lesson you’ll be having this year, that’s one more than Ron and me. I wonder when our O. W.L. results will come? Today? Today? But why didn’t you — oh my God — you should have said — I’m going to see whether any owls have come. . . . But it’s got to come off! I can’t go around looking like this forever! Yes, I can hardly breathe for laughing, Mrs. Weasley, you’re quite, quite sure no owls have arrived this morning? I know I messed up Ancient Runes, I definitely made at least one serious mistranslation. And the Defense Against the Dark Arts practical was no good at all. I thought Transfiguration went all right at the time, but looking back — Don’t, don’t, don’t! I know I’ve failed everything! We discuss our options with our Head of House, I asked Professor McGonagall at the end of last term. One for each of us, Oh no . . . oh no . . . oh no . . . Oh no! I — not bad, Harry, no! Think. . . . You mustn’t. . . . You’ll be in such trouble. . . . Oh — I don’t know, Harry, That’s him, isn’t it? Turning left? / / Look! He’s in there! / / Oh, I hope the door isn’t Imperturbable — You two stay here, Yes, I’ve already agreed it was fishy, Harry, But haven’t we agreed there could be a lot of explanations? Harry? What’s wrong? It seems very unlikely, Harry, What makes you think — ? I think he just wanted to get out of there, Harry, I’m not sure, Harry. . . . We can’t, Harry, Ron and I’ve got to go to the prefects’ carriage first and then patrol the corridors for a bit. Maybe he preferred the Inquisitorial Squad, Maybe being a prefect seems a bit tame after that. You’re covered in blood! Tergeo! Normal, Why shouldn’t it? Harry, what happened? We’ve been terrified! But — You missed the Sorting, anyway, More of the same, really . . . advising us all to unite in the face of our enemies, you know. “Not yet, but he always saves his proper speech for after the feast, doesn’t he? It can’t be long now.” So what did Professor Slughorn want? Him and everyone else here, People were interrogating us about it on the train, weren’t they, Ron? What happened to his hand? It looks as if it’s died, But there are some injuries you can’t cure . . . old curses . . . and there are poisons without antidotes. . . . But Harry, you said that Slughorn was going to be teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts! Harry! Well, I don’t know. . . . It would be like Malfoy to make himself seem more important than he is . . . but that’s a big lie to tell. . . . We’re going to need that time for studying, Ron! Hold it! Fanged Frisbees are banned, hand it over, Your adversary has no warning about what kind of magic you’re about to perform, which gives you a split-second advantage. You really shouldn’t have said it, What made you? Well, I thought he sounded a bit like you. Well, You said it wasn’t just memorizing a bunch of spells, you said it was just you and your brains and your guts — well, wasn’t that what Snape was saying? That it really comes down to being brave and quick-thinking? It’s Veritaserum, a colorless, odorless potion that forces the drinker to tell the truth, It’s Polyjuice Potion, sir, It’s Amortentia! It’s the most powerful love potion in the world! And the steam rising in characteristic spirals, Hermione Granger, sir. No, I don’t think so, sir. I’m Muggle-born, you see. Harry! Oh, Harry! It’s liquid luck, It makes you lucky! How are you doing that? No, no, the book says counterclockwise! Well, Ginny’s got a point, We ought to check that there’s nothing odd about it. I mean, all these funny instructions, who knows? Specialis Revelio! It seems all right, I mean, it really does seem to be . . . just a textbook. Ooooh! Good luck! We’ve got to go and explain, We didn’t hate it! I hate not talking to Hagrid, Oh, come on, Harry, It’s not Quidditch that’s popular, it’s you! You’ve never been more interesting, and frankly, you’ve never been more fanciable. Everyone knows you’ve been telling the truth now, don’t they? The whole Wizarding world has had to admit that you were right about Voldemort being back and that you really have fought him twice in the last two years and escaped both times. And now they’re calling you ‘the Chosen One’ — well, come on, can’t you see why people are fascinated by you? And you’ve been through all that persecution from the Ministry when they were trying to make out you were unstable and a liar. You can still see the marks on the back of your hand where that evil woman made you write with your own blood, but you stuck to your story anyway. . . . And it doesn’t hurt that you’ve grown about a foot over the summer either, Oh good, Now you can give that graffitied copy back. You did brilliantly, Ron! Oh dear, He’s still a bit scary, isn’t he? Oh dear! Harry! We’ve missed you! Hagrid, we really wanted to carry on with Care of Magical Creatures, you know. We did! But none of us could fit it into our schedules! Hagrid! What is it? Is there — is there anything we can do? We couldn’t have done, We smashed the entire stock of Ministry Time-Turners when we were there last summer. It was in the Daily Prophet. Oh, I wish you could come, I don’t want to go on my own! Right, Oh, look, your dad’s in here, Ron — he’s all right! It just says he’s been to visit the Malfoys’ house. ‘This second search of the Death Eater’s residence does not seem to have yielded any results. Arthur Weasley of the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects said that his team had been acting upon a confidential tip-off. / But how can he have done, Harry? We were all searched when we arrived, weren’t we? Right, Any Dark object would have been found, I know for a fact Crabbe had a shrunken head confiscated. So you see, Malfoy can’t have brought in anything dangerous! All the owls are being checked too, Filch told us so when he was jabbing those Secrecy Sensors everywhere he could reach. Was this spell, by any chance, another one from that potion book of yours? Was it? So you just decided to try out an unknown, handwritten incantation and see what would happen? Because it’s probably not Ministry of Magic–approved, And also, because I’m starting to think this Prince character was a bit dodgy. Dangling people upside down by the ankle? Who puts their time and energy into making up spells like that? Maybe your dad did use it, Harry, but he’s not the only one. We’ve seen a whole bunch of people use it, in case you’ve forgotten. Dangling people in the air. Making them float along, asleep, helpless. It’s got nothing to do with that! The Death Eaters can’t all be pure-blood, there aren’t enough pure-blood wizards left, I expect most of them are half-bloods pretending to be pure. It’s only Muggle-borns they hate, they’d be quite happy to let you and Ron join up. Yes, I can’t believe you’ve wriggled out of another one, They’re not that bad, you know. . . . They’re even quite fun sometimes. . . . Oh, look — they’ve got deluxe sugar quills — those would last hours! Harry Harry, you mustn’t! I know, Harry, but please don’t shout, people are staring, Go and sit down, I’ll get you a drink. Shh! Harry, I’d be annoyed too, I know it’s your things he’s stealing — Good idea, Ron, what are you staring at? I expect ‘nothing’s’ in the back getting more firewhisky, Shall we call it a day and go back to school, then? It’s Leanne, isn’t it? Did it just happen all of a sudden, or — ? She didn’t say who’d given it to her, Leanne? We’d better get up to school, We’ll be able to find out how she is. Come on. . . . But Harry, Borgin asked him if he wanted to take it with him, and Malfoy said no —  And also, it would be all wrapped up, so he wouldn’t have to touch it, and quite easy to hide inside a cloak, so nobody would see it! I think whatever he reserved at Borgin and Burkes was noisy or bulky, something he knew would draw attention to him if he carried it down the street — and in any case, I asked Borgin about the necklace, don’t you remember? When I went in to try and find out what Malfoy had asked him to keep, I saw it there. And Borgin just told me the price, he didn’t say it was already sold or anything — Goodness only knows, But whoever it was has had a narrow escape. No one could have opened that package without touching the necklace. Or you, Harry, Malfoy wasn’t in Hogsmeade! Dilligrout, You’re right, It wasn’t very well thought-out at all. I think it’s fascinating, It makes absolute sense to know as much about Voldemort as possible. How else will you find out his weaknesses? Oh, it was quite fun, really, I mean, he drones on about famous ex-pupils a bit, and he absolutely fawns on McLaggen because he’s so well-connected, but he gave us some really nice food and he introduced us to Gwenog Jones. That’s right, Personally, I thought she was a bit full of herself, but — No, we shouldn’t! Well, come on . . . we’d better get going. . . . Pass me a bowl, Anyway, Slughorn’s going to have a Christmas party, Harry, and there’s no way you’ll be able to wriggle out of this one because he actually asked me to check your free evenings, so he could be sure to have it on a night you can come. Just for the Slug Club, yes, Look, I didn’t make up the name ‘Slug Club’ — We’re allowed to bring guests, and I was going to ask you to come, but if you think it’s that stupid then I won’t bother! Yes, But obviously if you’d rather I hooked up with McLaggen . . . Hand that over, Harry, It says we’re supposed to puncture them with something sharp. . . . How are you both feeling? Don’t drink that, Ron! You just put something in that drink. You heard me. You’ve got the bottle in your hand right now! Ron, I warn you, don’t drink it! Stop bossing me around, Hermione. I want a word with you, Harry. You shouldn’t have done it. You heard Slughorn, it’s illegal. You know perfectly well what we’re talking about! You spiked Ron’s juice with lucky potion at breakfast! Felix Felicis! Yes you did, Harry, and that’s why everything went right, there were Slytherin players missing and Ron saved everything! I never said you couldn’t — Ron, you thought you’d been given it too! You go! I’m sick of Ron at the moment, I don’t know what I’m supposed to have done. . . . Right, I was just practicing. Ron seems to be enjoying the celebrations. Don’t pretend you didn’t see him, He wasn’t exactly hiding it, was — ? You shouldn’t leave Lavender waiting outside, She’ll wonder where you’ve gone. Oppugno! He’s at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes, I really couldn’t care less. And incidentally, you need to be careful. I’m not talking about your stupid so-called Prince, I’m talking about earlier. I went into the girls’ bathroom just before I came in here and there were about a dozen girls in there, including that Romilda Vane, trying to decide how to slip you a love potion. They’re all hoping they’re going to get you to take them to Slughorn’s party, and they all seem to have bought Fred and George’s love potions They didn’t have the potions with them in the bathroom, They were just discussing tactics. As I doubt whether even the Half-Blood Prince could dream up an antidote for a dozen different love potions at once, I’d just invite someone to go with you, that’ll stop all the others thinking they’ve still got a chance. It’s tomorrow night, they’re getting desperate. Well, just be careful what you drink, because Romilda Vane looked like she meant business, And when has anyone ever paid attention to what Filch has banned? Fred and George send them disguised as perfumes and cough potions. It’s part of their Owl Order Service. It was all on the back of the bottles they showed Ginny and me in the summer, I don’t go around putting potions in people’s drinks . . . or pretending to, either, which is just as bad. . . . Oh, Harry . . . not that again . . . Look, Secrecy Sensors detect jinxes, curses, and concealment charms, don’t they? They’re used to find Dark Magic and Dark objects. They’d have picked up a powerful curse, like the one on that necklace, within seconds. But something that’s just been put in the wrong bottle wouldn’t register — and anyway, love potions aren’t Dark or dangerous — — so it would be down to Filch to realize it wasn’t a cough potion, and he’s not a very good wizard, I doubt he can tell one potion from — The library is now closed, Despoiled! Desecrated! Befouled! She’ll ban you from the library if you’re not careful. Why did you have to bring that stupid book? Oh, ha ha . . . what-did-I-tell-you? Told you, Sooner you ask someone, sooner they’ll all leave you alone and you can — Well, good night, Harry, Oh yes, Thank you, Harry. Well, I’d better get going. . . . Hi, Are you going to Slughorn’s party tonight? Yes, I’m meeting Cormac at eight, and we’re — — we’re going up to the party together. Yeah, became Gryffindor Keeper. Oh — yes — didn’t you know? I like really good Quidditch players, Well, see you . . . Got to go and get ready for the party. . . . Hi, There you are, thank goodness! Hi, Luna! I thought he’d annoy Ron most, I debated for a while about Zacharias Smith, but I thought, on the whole — Yes, I did, and I’m starting to wish I’d chosen him, McLaggen makes Grawp look a gentleman. Let’s go this way, we’ll be able to see him coming, he’s so tall. . . . Do you really think I’d stoop that low? There’s a difference, I’ve got no plans to tell Ron anything about what might, or might not, have happened at Keeper tryouts. Quidditch! Is that all boys care about? Cormac hasn’t asked me one single question about myself, no, I’ve just been treated to ‘A Hundred Great Saves Made by Cormac McLaggen’ nonstop ever since — oh no, here he comes! Obviously, Harry, he was pretending to offer help so he could trick Malfoy into telling him what he’s doing. . . . Harry! Ginny! Did you have a good Christmas? I’ve got something for you, Harry, Oh, hang on — password. Abstinence. Overindulged over Christmas, apparently, She and her friend Violet drank their way through all the wine in that picture of drunk monks down by the Charms corridor. Anyway . . . There’s a table over here. . . . Coming, Ginny? Oh, fine, Nothing special. How was it at Won-Won’s? No, I can’t, So don’t even ask. It was the Fat Lady who drank a vat of five-hundred-year-old wine, Harry, not me. So what was this important news you wanted to tell me? Don’t you think — ? Yeah, No, I can’t, Hmm . . . did either of them actually mention Voldemort’s name? I don’t know, Maybe his father? How’s Lupin? Harry! And so have you, Harry! No, no, not History of Magic — Malfoy threatened Borgin with him! Back in Knockturn Alley, don’t you remember? He told Borgin that Greyback was an old family friend and that he’d be checking up on Borgin’s progress! It is pretty suspicious, Unless . . . Well . . . there is the possibility it was an empty threat. They must be really advanced Dark Magic, or why would Voldemort have wanted to know about them? I think it’s going to be difficult to get the information, Harry, you’ll have to be very careful about how you approach Slughorn, think out a strategy. . . . Oh, well, if Won-Won thinks that, you’d better do it, After all, when has Won-Won’s judgment ever been faulty? No! Golpalott’s-Third-Law-states-that-the-antidote-for-a-blended-poison-will-be-equal-to-more-than-the-sum-of-the-antidotes-for-each-of-the-separate-components. It’s a shame that the Prince won’t be able to help you much with this, Harry, You have to understand the principles involved this time. No shortcuts or cheats! And you thought of a bezoar all by yourself, did you, Harry? I haven’t found one single explanation of what Horcruxes do! Not a single one! I’ve been right through the restricted section and even in the most horrible books, where they tell you how to brew the most gruesome potions — nothing! All I could find was this, in the introduction to Magick Moste Evile — listen — ‘Of the Horcrux, wickedest of magical inventions, we shall not speak nor give direction. . . .’ I mean, why mention it then? Oh, shut up, Harry, where are you going? I expect your trainers are too small, Won-Won, Then the poisoner didn’t know Slughorn very well, Anyone who knew Slughorn would have known there was a good chance he’d keep something that tasty for himself. Well, I don’t think it’s Quidditch, but I think there’s a connection between the attacks, Well, for one thing, they both ought to have been fatal and weren’t, although that was pure luck. And for another, neither the poison nor the necklace seems to have reached the person who was supposed to be killed. Of course, that makes the person behind this even more dangerous in a way, because they don’t seem to care how many people they finish off before they actually reach their victim. Hasn’t he got any ideas, Hagrid? Surely not? Look out, You won’t find anything in there, He would if you’d just listened to Snape in our first year, I’m telling you, the stupid Prince isn’t going to be able to help you with this, Harry! There’s only one way to force someone to do what you want, and that’s the Imperius Curse, which is illegal — You’re going about it the wrong way, Only you can get the memory, Dumbledore says. That must mean you can persuade Slughorn where other people can’t. It’s not a question of slipping him a potion, anyone could do that — No, it isn’t, And ‘augury’ doesn’t begin O — R — G either. What kind of quill are you using? Yes, it must, because we were asked how we’d deal with dementors, not ‘Dugbogs,’ and I don’t remember you changing your name to ‘Roonil Wazlib’ either. It’s okay, we can fix it, Don’t let Lavender hear you saying that. There, What is this? What’s going on, Harry? You haven’t slept, Dobby? But surely, Harry, you didn’t tell him not to — I think it’ll be part of the magic of the room, If you need it to be Unplottable, it will be. But I don’t think you will, Harry, Malfoy already knew exactly how we were using the room, didn’t he, because that stupid Marietta had blabbed. He needed the room to become the headquarters of the D. A., so it did. But you don’t know what the room becomes when Malfoy goes in there, so you don’t know what to ask it to transform into. Kreacher’s done well too, But what’s all this about him going up there with a ‘variety of students’? How many people are in on it? You wouldn’t think he’d trust lots of them to know what he’s doing. . . . Do you mean to say, that that little girl whose scales I repaired — ? Hmmm . . . the Dark Mark we don’t know exists, Yes, we will, Yes, we will, But, Harry, before you get all excited, I still don’t think you’ll be able to get into the Room of Requirement without knowing what’s there first. And I don’t think you should forget that what you’re supposed to be concentrating on is getting that memory from Slughorn. Good night. I’ve already told you Instead of messing around outside the Room of Requirement you should go and find Slughorn and start appealing to his better nature. Yes! But it’s all right, he’s not dead — it’s Mundungus, he’s been arrested and sent to Azkaban!  Something to do with impersonating an Inferius during an attempted burglary .. . and someone called Octavius Pepper has vanished. . . . Oh, and how horrible, a nine-year-old boy has been arrested for trying to kill his grandparents, they think he was under the Imperius Curse. . . . No! There’s no point, you’ll just end up in detention again, leave it! You’d do better, when he confided this plan to Ron and her in the entrance hall, to go straight to Slughorn’s office and try and get that memory from him. Well, you’ve just got to keep at it, haven’t you? And what about you? Have you been up at the Room of Requirement all this time? It’s a bit odd, She’s supposed to be guarding the school, why’s she suddenly abandoning her post to come and see Dumbledore when he’s not even here? What on earth makes you say that? It’s a thought, But I still don’t know why she’d be bursting into the castle to see Dumbledore, if that’s really why she was here. . . . Yep, I doubt you’d find a woman who sulked for half an hour because Madam Rosmerta didn’t laugh at their joke about the hag, the Healer, and the Mimbulus mimbletonia. For the last time, just forget about Malfoy, It isn’t Lavender, Maybe he wants to check on how you’re doing? Oh, for heaven’s sake, It’s not just that, He’s asking us to leave the castle at night and he knows security’s a million times tighter and how much trouble we’d be in if we were caught. Hagrid We’ve risked a lot to help Hagrid out, but after all — Aragog’s dead. If it were a question of saving him — Harry, you can’t be thinking of going, It’s such a pointless thing to get detention for. Yes, he will, Look, Potions will be almost empty this afternoon, with us all off doing our tests. . . . Try and soften Slughorn up a bit then! Ron, that’s — that’s it! Of course! Why didn’t I think of it? What on earth is more important than this memory, Harry? It isn’t Lavender! They’re the Montgomery sisters and of course they don’t look happy, didn’t you hear what happened to their little brother? Well, their brother was attacked by a werewolf. The rumor is that their mother refused to help the Death Eaters. Anyway, the boy was only five and he died in St. Mungo’s, they couldn’t save him. Well, the rumor is that it was that Fenrir Greyback, Harry, you’ve got to get that memory. It’s all about stopping Voldemort, isn’t it? These dreadful things that are happening are all down to him. . . . And you too! Harry! Harry, I passed! He — he just failed, It was really unlucky, a tiny thing, the examiner just spotted that he’d left half an eyebrow behind. . . . How did it go with Slughorn? I know, it does seem really harsh. . . . What d’you mean? You’ve never taken any! Ron, you’re making it snow, Coward, Well, it was a bad night for romance all around. Ginny and Dean split up too, Harry. Oh, something really silly . . . She said he was always trying to help her through the portrait hole, like she couldn’t climb in herself . . . but they’ve been a bit rocky for ages. Of course, this puts you in a bit of a dilemma, doesn’t it? The Quidditch team, said Hermione. If Ginny and Dean aren’t speaking . . . “It’s a nice day. Katie! You’re back! Are you okay? You definitely went into the bathroom, then? So it must have been a girl or a woman who gave Katie the necklace, to be in the ladies’ bathroom. That would be a complete waste of potion, Luck can only get you so far, Harry. The situation with Slughorn was different; you always had the ability to persuade him, you just needed to tweak the circumstances a bit. Luck isn’t enough to get you through a powerful enchantment, though. Don’t go wasting the rest of that potion! You’ll need all the luck you can get if Dumbledore takes you along with him . . . I won’t say ‘I told you so,’ I told you there was something wrong with that Prince person, And I was right, wasn’t I? I don’t believe this, said Hermione. You’re actually defending — — got a reputation for Potions brilliance you don’t deserve, Well, of course I’m glad Harry wasn’t cursed! But you can’t call that Sectumsempra spell good, Ginny I want to talk to you, Harry. The so-called Half-Blood Prince. I’m not dropping it, until you’ve heard me out. Now, I’ve been trying to find out a bit about who might make a hobby of inventing Dark spells — He, he — who says it’s a he? Right! Look at that! Look at the picture! What? What? Well, why not? Harry, there aren’t any real princes in the Wizarding world! It’s either a nickname, a made-up title somebody’s given themselves, or it could be their actual name, couldn’t it? No, listen! If, say, her father was a wizard whose surname was Prince, and her mother was a Muggle, then that would make her a ‘half-blood Prince’! But it would! Maybe she was proud of being half a Prince! The truth is that you don’t think a girl would have been clever enough, The library, There’s a whole collection of old Prophets up there. Well, I’m going to find out more about Eileen Prince if I can. Harry- No! We don’t want it, you take it, who knows what you’re going to be facing? Outside Snape’s office, yes, with Luna. We hung around for ages outside it and nothing happened.. . . We didn’t know what was going on upstairs, Ron had taken the map. . . . It was nearly midnight when Professor Flitwick came sprinting down into the dungeons.He was shouting about Death Eaters in the castle, I don’t think he really registered that Luna and I were there at all, he just burst his way into Snape’s office We went into his office to see if we could help Professor Flitwick and found him unconscious on the floor . . . and oh, it’s so obvious now, Snape must have Stupefied Flitwick, but we didn’t realize, Harry, we didn’t realize, we just let Snape go!” No, They’re still looking for Snape but no sign . . . Harry, I found something out this morning, in the library. No, I’ve been trying, Harry, but I haven’t found anything. . . . There are a couple of reasonably well-known wizards with those initials — Rosalind Antigone Bungs . . . Rupert ‘Axebanger’ Brookstanton . . . but they don’t seem to fit at all. Judging by that note, the person who stole the Horcrux knew Voldemort, and I can’t find a shred of evidence that Bungs or Axebanger ever had anything to do with him. . . . No, actually, it’s about . . . well, Snape. Well, it’s just that I was sort of right about the Half-Blood Prince business, No — no — Harry, I didn’t mean that! It’s just that I was right about Eileen Prince once owning the book. You see . . . she was Snape’s mother! I was going through the rest of the old Prophets and there was a tiny announcement about Eileen Prince marrying a man called Tobias Snape, and then later an announcement saying that she’d given birth to a — Well . . . yes, So . . . I was sort of right. Snape must have been proud of being ‘half a Prince,’ you see? Tobias Snape was a Muggle from what it said in the Prophet. I don’t think he wanted to associate himself with that book, I don’t think Dumbledore would have liked it very much if he’d known. And even if Snape pretended it hadn’t been his, Slughorn would have recognized his writing at once. Anyway, the book was left in Snape’s old classroom, and I’ll bet Dumbledore knew his mother was called ‘Prince. ’ ‘Evil’ is a strong word, I’m trying to say, Harry, that you’re putting too much blame on yourself. I thought the Prince seemed to have a nasty sense of humor, but I would never have guessed he was a potential killer. . . . I told them you’d take it like this, So, Potter — some of your hair, if you please. Ooh, you look much tastier than Crabbe and Goyle, Harry, Oh, you know what I mean — Goyle’s potion looked like bogies. Harry, your eyesight really is awful, The last words Albus Dumbledore spoke to the pair of us? Stan? But I thought he was in Azkaban? Lost an — ? But that’s impossible, Harry. You mean that you did magic without meaning to; you reacted instinctively. Hi, Harry, Oh, Ron’s mum forgot that she asked Ginny and me to change the sheets yesterday, Even if the Killing Curse missed, Mad-Eye still fell about a thousand feet, Of course we don’t want him to be dead! It’s dreadful that he’s dead! But we’re being realistic! Don’t! Oh . . . thanks, Ron. . . . I’m sorry. . . . It’s just so awf-ful, isn’t it? R-right after Dumbledore . . . I j-just n-never imagined Mad-Eye dying, somehow, he seemed so tough! ‘C-constant vigilance,’ I’m sorry, I’m sorry! Just trying to decide which ones to take with us, said Hermione. When we’re looking for the Horcruxes. Ha ha, I wonder . . . will we need to translate runes? It’s possible. . . . I think we’d better take it, to be safe. As we knew he would, You know, I think I will take Hogwarts: A History. Even if we’re not going back there, I don’t think I’d feel right if I didn’t have it with — No, Harry, you listen, We’re coming with you. That was decided months ago — years, really. Let’s see, I’ve also modified my parents’ memories so that they’re convinced they’re really called Wendell and Monica Wilkins, and that their life’s ambition is to move to Australia, which they have now done. That’s to make it more difficult for Voldemort to track them down and interrogate them about me — or you, because unfortunately, I’ve told them quite a bit about you. Assuming I survive our hunt for the Horcruxes, I’ll find Mum and Dad and lift the enchantment. If I don’t — well, I think I’ve cast a good enough charm to keep them safe and happy. Wendell and Monica Wilkins don’t know that they’ve got a daughter, you see. Didn’t realize that Ron and I know perfectly well what might happen if we come with you? Well, we do. Ron, show Harry what you’ve done. Go on, he needs to know! But hopefully it’ll look like I’ve gone away with Mum and Dad; a lot of Muggle-borns are talking about going into hiding at the moment, Fleur’s sister’s a bridesmaid, she needs to be here for the rehearsal, and she’s too young to come on her own, What we really need to decide, is where we’re going after we leave here. Don’t you think there’s a possibility that Voldemort’s keeping a watch on Godric’s Hollow? He might expect you to go back and visit your parents’ graves once you’re free to go wherever you like? Or she, Yeah, to find out whether or not it’s destroyed. Well, I’ve been researching that. There weren’t, Dumbledore removed them all, but he — he didn’t destroy them. It — it wasn’t stealing! They were still library books, even if Dumbledore had taken them off the shelves. Anyway, if he really didn’t want anyone to get at them, I’m sure he would have made it much harder to — Well . . . it was easy, I just did a Summoning Charm. You know — Accio. And — they zoomed out of Dumbledore’s study window right into the girls’ dormitory. Just after his — Dumbledore’s — funeral, Right after we agreed we’d leave school and go and look for the Horcruxes. When I went back upstairs to get my things it — it just occurred to me that the more we knew about them, the better it would be . . . and I was alone in there . . . so I tried .. . and it worked. They flew straight in through the open window and I — I packed them. I can’t believe Dumbledore would have been angry, it’s not as though we’re going to use the information to make a Horcrux, is it? This is the one that gives explicit instructions on how to make a Horcrux. Secrets of the Darkest Art — it’s a horrible book, really awful, full of evil magic. I wonder when Dumbledore removed it from the library. . . . If he didn’t do it until he was headmaster, I bet Voldemort got all the instruction he needed from here. And the more I’ve read about them, the more horrible they seem, and the less I can believe that he actually made six. It warns in this book how unstable you make the rest of your soul by ripping it, and that’s just by making one Horcrux! Yes, but it would be excruciatingly painful. Remorse, You’ve got to really feel what you’ve done. There’s a footnote. Apparently the pain of it can destroy you. I can’t see Voldemort attempting it somehow, can you? Yes, because it warns Dark wizards how strong they have to make the enchantments on them. From all that I’ve read, what Harry did to Riddle’s diary was one of the few really foolproof ways of destroying a Horcrux. It doesn’t have to be a basilisk fang, It has to be something so destructive that the Horcrux can’t repair itself. Basilisk venom only has one antidote, and it’s incredibly rare — Exactly, Our problem is that there are very few substances as destructive as basilisk venom, and they’re all dangerous to carry around with you. That’s a problem we’re going to have to solve, though, because ripping, smashing, or crushing a Horcrux won’t do the trick. You’ve got to put it beyond magical repair. Because a Horcrux is the complete opposite of a human being. Look, if I picked up a sword right now, Ron, and ran you through with it, I wouldn’t damage your soul at all. But my point is that whatever happens to your body, your soul will survive, untouched, But it’s the other way round with a Horcrux. The fragment of soul inside it depends on its container, its enchanted body, for survival. It can’t exist without it. And once the diary was properly destroyed, the bit of soul trapped in it could no longer exist. Ginny tried to get rid of the diary before you did, flushing it away, but obviously it came back good as new. While the magical container is still intact, the bit of soul inside it can flit in and out of someone if they get too close to the object. I don’t mean holding it for too long, it’s nothing to do with touching it, I mean close emotionally. Ginny poured her heart out into that diary, she made herself incredibly vulnerable. You’re in trouble if you get too fond of or dependent on the Horcrux. Oh yes, we will . . . we’re sorry . . . Ron! Ron — We’re fine, How are you? How can you tell? Isn’t it obvious? They wanted to examine whatever he’s left us. You had no right to do that! That law was created to stop wizards passing on Dark artifacts, and the Ministry is supposed to have powerful evidence that the deceased’s possessions are illegal before seizing them! Are you telling me that you thought Dumbledore was trying to pass us something cursed? No, I’m hoping to do some good in the world! No, it’ll be because the thirty-one days are up, They can’t keep the objects longer than that unless they can prove they’re dangerous. Right? Ron looked around at Harry and Hermione, to see Hermione giving him a stop-talking-now! sort of look, but the damage was done: You’re being modest, Ron, Dumbledore was very fond of you. He . . . he knew I liked books, I don’t know. He must have thought I’d enjoy it. No, I didn’t, And if the Ministry hasn’t found any hidden codes in this book in thirty-one days, I doubt that I will. Oh, it can’t be a reference to the fact Harry’s a great Seeker, that’s way too obvious, There must be a secret message from Dumbledore hidden in the icing! Because Snitches have flesh memories, That’s all, then, is it? It belongs to Harry! It chose him, he was the one who found it, it came to him out of the Sorting Hat — Muffliato, Times change, Now, show us that Deluminator. The thing is, we could have achieved that with Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder. I know, but surely he wouldn’t have singled you out in his will just to help us turn out the lights! Definitely, He couldn’t tell us in the will why he was leaving us these things, but that still doesn’t explain . . . Well, exactly, If these things are important enough to pass on right under the nose of the Ministry, you’d think he’d have let us know why . . . unless he thought it was obvious? No, When Scrimgeour made you take it, Harry, I was so sure that something was going to happen! What do you mean? Writing! There’s writing on it, quick, look! And as for this book, The Tales of Beedle the Bard . . . I’ve never even heard of them! No, I’m not! Do you know them, then? What? What was that last one? Ron, you know full well Harry and I were brought up by Muggles! We didn’t hear stories like that when we were little, we heard ‘Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs’ and ‘Cinderella’ — So these are children’s stories? But I wonder why Dumbledore thought I should read them? All the same, we should get to bed, It wouldn’t do to oversleep tomorrow. Viktor! I didn’t know you were — goodness — it’s lovely to see — how are you? Ron! Ron, where are you? Ron! Ron! Ron! Tottenham Court Road, Walk, just walk, we need to find somewhere for you to change. It’s okay, I’ve got the Cloak, I’ve got clothes for both of you, Just try and act naturally until — this will do. Yes, they’re here, Undetectable Extension Charm, Tricky, but I think I’ve done it okay; anyway, I managed to fit everything we need in here. Oh, damn, that’ll be the books, and I had them all stacked by subject. . . . Oh well. . . . Harry, you’d better take the Invisibility Cloak. Ron, hurry up and change. . . . I told you at the Burrow, I’ve had the essentials packed for days, you know, in case we needed to make a quick getaway. I packed your rucksack this morning, Harry, after you changed, and put it in here. . . . I just had a feeling. . . . Thank you, Please, Harry, get that Cloak on! We can’t worry about that now, It’s you they’re after, Harry, and we’ll just put everyone in even more danger by going back. Come on, I think we ought to keep moving, Petrificus Totalus! D-diffindo, Oh, I’m so sorry, Ron, my hand’s shaking! Diffindo! Never mind what they’re called! How did they find us? What are we going to do? Nor have I, but I know the theory. Obliviate. Oh, I’m so sorry, But how did they find us? How did they know where we were? You — you don’t think you’ve still got your Trace on you, do you, Harry? As far as you know, What if the Death Eaters have found a way to put it on a seventeen-year-old? “We’re not splitting up!” But — I think somebody’s been in here, That m-must have b-been the T-Tongue-Tying Curse Mad-Eye set up for Snape! That . . . that was . . . . Before we go any farther, I think we’d better check, Homenum revelio. It did what I meant it to do! That was a spell to reveal human presence, and there’s nobody here except us! Let’s go up, Your scar, again? I thought that connection had closed! But then you’ve got to close your mind! Harry, Dumbledore didn’t want you to use that connection, he wanted you to shut it down, that’s why you were supposed to use Occlumency! Otherwise Voldemort can plant false images in your mind, remember — They’re all right, they’re all right! I don’t want to be on my own. Could we use the sleeping bags I’ve brought and camp in here tonight? Harry, I’ve got it here. What’s the matter? In your mum’s letter? But I didn’t see — Sirius’s brother? That fits! If he was a Death Eater he had access to Voldemort, and if he became disenchanted, then he would have wanted to bring Voldemort down! Ron! RON! Get up here, quick! Alohomora. They’re all about Voldemort, Regulus seems to have been a fan for a few years before he joined the Death Eaters. . . . Why did you come up here anyway? What have you been doing? There’s an easier way, Accio Locket! Oh, it could still be here, but under counter-enchantments, Charms to prevent it being summoned magically, you know. We search manually, It could be somewhere else in the house, though, Whether he’d managed to destroy it or not, he’d want to keep it hidden from Voldemort, wouldn’t he? Remember all those awful things we had to get rid of when we were here last time? That clock that shot bolts at everyone and those old robes that tried to strangle Ron; Regulus might have put them there to protect the locket’s hiding place, even though we didn’t realize it at . . . at . . . . . . at the time, There was a locket. In the cabinet in the drawing room. Nobody could open it. And we . . . we . . . Harry, let him up! Of course, Voldemort would have considered the ways of house-elves far beneath his notice, just like all the purebloods who treat them like animals . . . It would never have occurred to him that they might have magic that he didn’t. Well then, You didn’t disobey orders at all! Kreacher! Harry, Kreacher doesn’t think like that, He’s a slave; house-elves are used to bad, even brutal treatment; what Voldemort did to Kreacher wasn’t that far out of the common way. What do wizard wars mean to an elf like Kreacher? He’s loyal to people who are kind to him, and Mrs. Black must have been, and Regulus certainly was, so he served them willingly and parroted their beliefs. I know what you’re going to say, that Regulus changed his mind . . . but he doesn’t seem to have explained that to Kreacher, does he? And I think I know why. Kreacher and Regulus’s family were all safer if they kept to the old pure-blood line. Regulus was trying to protect them all. I don’t think so, or they’d have sent Snape in after us, wouldn’t they? Yes, otherwise he’d have been able to tell that lot how to get in, wouldn’t he? But they’re probably watching to see whether we turn up. They know that Harry owns the house, after all. Wizarding wills are examined by the Ministry, remember? They’ll know Sirius left you the place. Will you stop it! Well, can’t you find something useful to occupy yourself? Dumbledore left me this book, Ron — Oh, thank goodness, We wondered, whether Harry could still have the Trace on him? Were they Death Eaters or Ministry people? And are they bothering to give an excuse for torturing Harry’s whereabouts out of people? So Death Eaters have taken over the Daily Prophet too? But surely people realize what’s going on? ‘Recent research undertaken by the Department of Mysteries reveals that magic can only be passed from person to person when Wizards reproduce.  ‘The Ministry is determined to root out such usurpers of magical power, and to this end has issued an invitation to every so-called Muggle-born to present themselves for interview by the newly appointed Muggle-born Registration Commission. Thank you, Ron, but I couldn’t let you — Ron, as we’re on the run with Harry Potter, the most wanted person in the country, I don’t think it matters. If I was going back to school it would be different. What’s Voldemort planning for Hogwarts? But what about Tonks? Well, you’re married! How does she feel about you going away with us? Remus, is everything all right . . . you know . . . between you and — Oh, how wonderful! Harry, no! Remus, No — no — we mustn’t fight! said Hermione, launching herself between them. Harry — said Hermione, stretching out a consoling hand, but he shrugged it off and walked away, his eyes on the fire Hermione had conjured. All the same . . . Expelliarmus! For your information, none of the rest of us Disapparated, You’ve still got it! Aguamenti! ‘Severus Snape, long-standing Potions master at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, was today appointed headmaster in the most important of several staffing changes at the ancient school. ‘I welcome the opportunity to uphold our finest Wizarding traditions and values —’ Like committing murder and cutting off people’s ears, I suppose! Snape, headmaster! Snape in Dumbledore’s study — Merlin’s pants! I’ll be back in a minute! I remembered this, Phineas Nigellus, Snape could send Phineas Nigellus to look inside this house for him, But let him try it now, all Phineas Nigellus will be able to see is the inside of my handbag. What’s happened? So, Harry, what else happened today? And what about that funny old witch and that little wizard in the navy robes? How do you know he works for Magical Maintenance? But you never told us that! There’s nothing in here about navy blue robes, nothing! Ron, it all matters! If we’re going to get into the Ministry and not give ourselves away when they’re bound to be on the lookout for intruders, every little detail matters! We’ve been over and over this, I mean, what’s the point of all these reconnaissance trips if you aren’t even bothering to tell us — You do realize, don’t you, that there’s probably no more dangerous place in the whole world for us to be right now than the Ministry of — Tomorrow? You aren’t serious, Harry? But we haven’t got any! I don’t know, Harry, I don’t know. . . . There are an awful lot of things that could go wrong, so much relies on chance. . . . Oh, don’t start that again! I thought we’d settled this. And you’re supposed to be dying of spattergroit at the Burrow! If anyone shouldn’t go, it’s Harry, he’s got a ten-thousand-Galleon price on his head — Try Finite Incantatem, that should stop the rain if it’s a hex or curse; if it doesn’t, something’s gone wrong with an Atmospheric Charm, which will be more difficult to fix, so as an interim measure try Impervius to protect his belongings — Y-yes, That’s — that’s pretty, Dolores, Ron, it’s me, Harry! Harry! Harry, Mrs. Cattermole! Wait, I’m trying something up here — I know that, Harry, but if she wakes up and the locket’s gone — I need to duplicate it — Geminio!  There . . .That should fool her. . . . Let’s see. . . . Relashio! Harry, how are we going to get out of here with all those dementors outside the door? Expec — Expecto patronum, EXPECTO PATRONUM! Harry, Harry! What are we going to — ? Splinched, Harry, quickly, in my bag, there’s a small bottle labeled ‘Essence of Dittany’ — Quickly! He’s fainted, Unstopper it for me, Harry, my hands are shaking. It’s all I feel safe doing, There are spells that would put him completely right, but I daren’t try in case I do them wrong and cause more damage. . . . He’s lost so much blood already. . . . Harry, I don’t think we’re going to be able to go back there. Harry, I think he can. I — I forced him to let go with a Revulsion Jinx, but I’d already taken him inside the Fidelius Charm’s protection. Since Dumbledore died, we’re Secret-Keepers, so I’ve given him the secret, haven’t I? Harry, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry! How d’you feel? In the woods where they held the Quidditch World Cup, I wanted somewhere enclosed, undercover, and this was — If we’re staying, we should put some protective enchantments around the place, Salvio Hexia . . . Protego Totalum . . . Repello Muggletum . . . Muffliato . . . You could get out the tent, Harry. . . . In the bag! Apparently he didn’t want it back, his lumbago’s so bad, so Ron’s dad said I could borrow it. Erecto! Cave Inimicum, That’s as much as I can do. At the very least, we should know they’re coming, I can’t guarantee it will keep out Vol — Got — got what? Well, we were running for our lives from the Death Eaters, weren’t we? Here. I think so, There’d be some sign of damage if it had been magically destroyed. What are we going to do with it? Harry! I know it was your scar! I can tell by the look on your face! You were looking into Vol — Fine, You-Know-Who’s mind, then! If you just learned to apply Occlumency — I think I’d better take over the watch if you’re so tired you’re falling asleep, No, you’re obviously exhausted. Go and lie down. Shut up, Ron, Harry, what happened? Why do you think you couldn’t make your Patronus? You managed perfectly yesterday! Of course! Harry, give me the locket! Come on, the Horcrux, Harry, you’re still wearing it! Better? Harry, you don’t think you’ve been possessed, do you? Hmm, Well, maybe we ought not to wear it. We can just keep it in the tent. Oh, all right, all right, But we’ll take turns wearing it, so nobody keeps it on too long. Fine, but we’ll go somewhere else to find it, There’s no point staying where we know dementors are swooping around. It’s not stealing, is it? There can’t be anything there. He’d already made five of his Horcruxes before he went into exile, and Dumbledore was certain the snake is the sixth, We know the snake’s not in Albania, it’s usually with Vol — Fine! The snake is usually with You-Know-Who — happy? But Dumbledore would have found it, Harry! You told us that You-Know-Who asked Dumbledore to give him a job after he left, And Dumbledore thought he only wanted to come back to try and find something, probably another founder’s object, to make into another Horcrux? But he didn’t get the job, did he? So he never got the chance to find a founder’s object there and hide it in the school! We could try digging in the foundations? Your mother can’t produce food out of thin air, No one can. Food is the first of the five Principal Exceptions to Gamp’s Law of Elemental Transfigur — It’s impossible to make good food out of nothing! Harry caught the fish and I did my best with it! I notice I’m always the one who ends up sorting out the food, because I’m a girl, I suppose! You can do the cooking tomorrow, Ron, you can find the ingredients and try and charm them into something worth eating, and I’ll sit here and pull faces and moan and you can see how you — How can you side with him, he hardly ever does the cook — I did everything, Muffliato, Muggle-Repelling and Disillusionment Charms, all of it. They shouldn’t be able to hear or see us, whoever they are. I know! Here . . . we . . . are . . . If somebody swapped the real sword for the fake while it was in Dumbledore’s office, Phineas Nigellus would have seen it happen, he hangs right beside the case! Unless he was asleep, said Harry, but he still held his breath as Hermione knelt down in front of the empty canvas, her wand directed at its center, cleared her throat, then said:“Er — Phineas? Phineas Nigellus?” Phineas Nigellus? Phineas Nigellus? Professor Black? Please could we talk to you? Please? “Obscuro!” I’m very sorry, Professor Black, but it’s a necessary precaution! Neville is not an idiot and Luna is not an oddity! Hagrid’s not an oaf! What we really wanted to know, Professor Black, is whether anyone else has, um, taken out the sword at all? Maybe it’s been taken away for cleaning or — or something? Professor Black, couldn’t you just tell us, please, when was the last time the sword was taken out of its case? Before Ginny took it out, I mean? But Dumbledore would have found it, Harry! Harry, Goblin-made blades imbibe only that which strengthen them — Harry, that sword’s impregnated with basilisk venom! — and he must have realized they wouldn’t let you have it if he put it in his will — — and he left the real one — where? Think! Think! Where would he have left it? Somewhere in Hogsmeade? But Snape knows how to get in, wouldn’t that be a bit risky? Not enough to tell him that he had swapped the swords, You can do the cooking tomorrow, Ron, you can find the ingredients and try and charm them into something worth eating, and I’ll sit here and pull faces and moan and you can see how you — Ron, no — please — come back, come back! Ron! Ron, Please take it off. You wouldn’t be talking like this if you hadn’t been wearing it all day. Harry, Harry, Ron, I don’t think it means anything new has happened, anything we don’t know about; think, Ron, Bill’s already scarred, plenty of people must have seen that George has lost an ear by now, and you’re supposed to be on your deathbed with spattergroit, I’m sure that’s all he meant — Protego! What? I was, Yes — yes, I’m staying. Ron, we said we’d go with Harry, we said we’d help — Ron, He’s g-g-gone! Disapparated! Hmm? Harry, could you help me with something? Look at that symbol, I know that, but it isn’t a rune and it’s not in the syllabary, either. All along I thought it was a picture of an eye, but I don’t think it is! It’s been inked in, look, somebody’s drawn it there, it isn’t really part of the book. Think, have you ever seen it before? Well, that’s what I thought too! What? Grindelwald’s mark? I’ve never heard that Grindelwald had a mark. There’s no mention of it in anything I’ve ever read about him. That’s very odd. If it’s a symbol of Dark Magic, what’s it doing in a book of children’s stories? I know. . . . Perhaps he thought it was an eye, just like I did. All the other stories have little pictures over the titles. Hmm? Yes, Yes, I’ve been wondering that too. I really think we’ll have to. Of course I did. I agree, I think we should. I mean, I can’t think of anywhere else it could be either. It’ll be dangerous, but the more I think about it, the more likely it seems it’s there. Well, the sword, Harry! Dumbledore must have known you’d want to go back there, and I mean, Godric’s Hollow is Godric Gryffindor’s birthplace — Harry, did you ever even open A History of Magic? Well, as the village is named after him I’d have thought you might have made the connection, There’s a bit about the village in A History of Magic, wait . . . You and your parents aren’t mentioned, because Professor Bagshot doesn’t cover anything later than the end of the nineteenth century. But you see? Godric’s Hollow, Godric Gryffindor, Gryffindor’s sword; don’t you think Dumbledore would have expected you to make the connection? Who? Oh, Well, Well, I suppose — Harry, what if Bathilda’s got the sword? What if Dumbledore entrusted it to her? Yes, but we’ll have to think it through carefully, Harry. We’ll need to practice Disapparating together under the Invisibility Cloak for a start, and perhaps Disillusionment Charms would be sensible too, unless you think we should go the whole hog and use Polyjuice Potion? In that case we’ll need to collect hair from somebody. I actually think we’d better do that, Harry, the thicker our disguises the better. . . . All this snow! Why didn’t we think of snow? After all our precautions, we’ll leave prints! We’ll just have to get rid of them — you go in front, I’ll do it — Harry, I think it’s Christmas Eve! I’m sure it is, They . . . they’ll be in there, won’t they? Your mum and dad? I can see the graveyard behind it. Harry, look! Keep your voice down, Harry, here! No, but look! Are you sure he never mentioned — ? Here! Oh no, sorry! I thought it said Potter. Harry, come back a moment. Look at this! Harry, that’s the mark in the book! It says Ig — Ignotus, I think. . . . Harry, they’re here . . . right here. It doesn’t mean defeating death in the way the Death Eaters mean it, Harry, It means . . . you know . . . living beyond death. Living after death. Harry, stop. There’s someone there. Someone watching us. I can tell. There, over by the bushes. I saw something move, I could have sworn I did. . . . Muggles who’ve just been laying flowers on your parents’ grave! Harry, I’m sure there’s someone over there! For a moment Harry considered suggesting they take refuge inside it, but before he could say anything Hermione murmured, Let’s go this way, and pulled him down the dark street leading out of the village in the opposite direction from which they had entered. How are we going to find Bathilda’s house? Harry? What do you think? Harry? Harry — I don’t . . . oh! I wonder why nobody’s ever rebuilt it? You’re not going to go inside? It looks unsafe, it might — oh, Harry, look!” They shouldn’t have written on the sign! How does she know? Harry, I’m not sure about this, Harry, what are you doing? Mrs. — Miss — Bagshot? Was there something you wanted to tell us? All right, let’s go. Why? Do you really think she knows who you are? All right, Harry? Harry? Confringo! Harry, it’s all right, you’re all right! Harry, it’s okay, wake up, wake up! Harry, Harry, Do you feel all — all right? Yes, I had to use a Hover Charm to get you into your bunk, I couldn’t lift you. You’ve been . . . Well, you haven’t been quite . . . You’ve been ill, Quite ill. Hours ago. It’s nearly morning. Yes, You’ve been shouting and moaning and . . . things, I couldn’t get the Horcrux off you, It was stuck, stuck to your chest. You’ve got a mark; I’m sorry, I had to use a Severing Charm to get it away. The snake bit you too, but I’ve cleaned the wound and put some dittany on it. . . . It’s not your fault. I wanted to go too; I really thought Dumbledore might have left the sword there for you. Harry? Harry? What happened when she took you upstairs? Was the snake hiding somewhere? Did it just come out and kill her and attack you? W-what? The snake was inside her? Harry, He was Harry. . . . Harry, not Voldemort . . . and the thing that was rustling was not a snake. . . Harry, R-Reparo. Harry, I’m so, so sorry. I think it was me. As we were leaving, you know, the snake was coming for us, and so I cast a Blasting Curse, and it rebounded everywhere, and it must have — must have hit — Harry, Remember . . . remember Ron? When he broke his wand, crashing the car? It was never the same again, he had to get a new one. Harry? Do you mind if I talk to you? Harry, you wanted to know who that man in the picture was. Well . . . I’ve got the book. It was in Bathilda’s sitting room, just lying there. . . . This note was sticking out of the top of it. ‘Dear Batty, Thanks for your help. Here’s a copy of the book, hope you like it.  I think it must have arrived while the real Bathilda was alive, but perhaps she wasn’t in any fit state to read it? You’re still really angry at me, aren’t you? Grindelwald? Harry — Harry. Listen to me. It — it doesn’t make very nice reading — Harry. Yes, I — I did. I think that’s the worst bit. I know Bathilda thought it was all just talk, but ‘For the Greater Good’ became Grindelwald’s slogan, his justification for all the atrocities he committed later. And . . . from that . . . it looks like Dumbledore gave him the idea. They say ‘For the Greater Good’ was even carved over the entrance to Nurmengard. The prison Grindelwald had built to hold his opponents. He ended up in there himself, once Dumbledore had caught him. Anyway, it’s — it’s an awful thought that Dumbledore’s ideas helped Grindelwald rise to power. But on the other hand, even Rita can’t pretend that they knew each other for more than a few months one summer when they were both really young, and — Harry. All that ‘right to rule’ rubbish, it’s ‘Magic Is Might’ all over again. But Harry, his mother had just died, he was stuck alone in the house — I don’t believe it, Whatever was wrong with that girl, I don’t think she was a Squib. The Dumbledore we knew would never, ever have allowed — Harry. It’s as simple as that! Maybe he did believe these things when he was seventeen, but the whole of the rest of his life was devoted to fighting the Dark Arts! Dumbledore was the one who stopped Grindelwald, the one who always voted for Muggle protection and Muggle-born rights, who fought You-Know-Who from the start, and who died trying to bring him down! Harry. He loved you, I know he loved you. The Forest of Dean, I came camping here once with my mum and dad. What’s wrong? Harry? Are you all right? What? Who — ? You — complete — arse — Ronald — Weasley! I will not calm down! Give me back my wand! Give it back to me! Give it back to me! Don’t you tell me what to do, Harry Potter! Don’t you dare! Give it back now! And YOU! Come back! I called you! I begged you to come back! Oh, you’re sorry! You come back after weeks — weeks — and you think it’s all going to be all right if you just say sorry? Oh, I don’t know! Rack your brains, Ron, that should only take a couple of seconds — I don’t care! I don’t care what he’s done! Weeks and weeks, we could have been dead for all he knew — What it’s been like for you? Gosh, what a gripping story, You must have been simply terrified. Oh yes, You-Know-Who’s snake turned up, it nearly killed both of us, and then You-Know-Who himself arrived and missed us by about a second. Imagine losing fingernails, Harry! That really puts our sufferings into perspective, doesn’t it? One thing I would like to know, though, How exactly did you find us tonight? That’s important. Once we know, we’ll be able to make sure we’re not visited by anyone else we don’t want to see. The Deluminator? Me? What? No, actually, We’ve been Disapparating under the Invisibility Cloak as an extra precaution. And we left really early, because, as Harry says, we’d heard somebody blundering around. What? But it must have been a Patronus! Couldn’t you see who was casting it? Didn’t you see anyone? And it led you to the sword! I can’t believe this! Then what happened? And . . . and it went? Just like that? I still haven’t ruled it out, You just need to practice, It’s all a matter of confidence, Harry. We need to talk, I want to go and see Xenophilius Lovegood. Xenophilius Lovegood. Luna’s father. I want to go and talk to him! It’s that mark, the mark in Beedle the Bard. Look at this! The signature, Look at the signature, Harry! It keeps cropping up, doesn’t it? I know Viktor said it was Grindelwald’s mark, but it was definitely on that old grave in Godric’s Hollow, and the dates on the headstone were long before Grindelwald came along! And now this! Well, we can’t ask Dumbledore or Grindelwald what it means — I don’t even know whether Grindelwald’s still alive — but we can ask Mr. Lovegood. He was wearing the symbol at the wedding. I’m sure this is important, Harry! But it keeps appearing, Harry! Dumbledore left me The Tales of Beedle the Bard, how do you know we’re not supposed to find out about the sign? I’m sure this is important! Maybe . . . maybe it’s something you need to find out for yourself, No, it doesn’t, but I still think we ought to talk to Mr. Lovegood. A symbol that links Dumbledore, Grindelwald, and Godric’s Hollow? You’d better take off the Invisibility Cloak, Harry, It’s you Mr. Lovegood wants to help, not us. No it isn’t! But Harry, it’s an Erumpent horn! It’s a Class B Tradeable Material and it’s an extraordinarily dangerous thing to have in a house! There’s a description in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them! Mr. Lovegood, you need to get rid of it straightaway, don’t you know it can explode at the slightest touch? Mr. Lovegood, I recognize the grooved markings around the base, that’s an Erumpent horn and it’s incredibly dangerous — I don’t know where you got it — Where’s Luna? Let’s see what she thinks. Well, I agree with Ron, Awful old hypocrite, telling everyone else to help you and trying to worm out of it himself. And for heaven’s sake keep away from that horn. But what are the Deathly Hallows? I’ve got a copy, Mr. Lovegood, I’ve got it right here. Er . . . all right, It’s a fairy tale, Harry! Well, there you are. Sorry? But there’s no mention of the words ‘Deathly Hallows’ in the story, But then . . . do you mean . . . that you believe these objects — these Hallows — actually exist? But, Mr. Lovegood, how can you possibly believe — ? Mr. Lovegood, We all know that there are such things as Invisibility Cloaks. They are rare, but they exist. But — All right, Say the Cloak existed . . . what about the stone, Mr. Lovegood? The thing you call the Resurrection Stone? Well, how can that be real? I’m sorry, How can I possibly prove it doesn’t exist? Do you expect me to get hold of — of all the pebbles in the world and test them? I mean, you could claim that anything’s real if the only basis for believing in it is that nobody’s proved it doesn’t exist! Mr. Lovegood, That was the name on the grave with the mark on it, in Godric’s Hollow, Ignotus Peverell. Harry, look at this. Hand over Harry? It’s a fairy tale, Harry! All right, Do you trust me, Harry? Okay then, give me the Invisibility Cloak. Ron, you’re going to put it on. Please, Ron! Harry, hold on tight to my hand, Ron, grab my shoulder. Hold tight, Hold tight . . . any second . . . Obliviate! Deprimo! Protego Totalum . . . Salvio Hexia . . . Cave Inimicum . . . Didn’t I say it was an Erumpent horn, didn’t I tell him? And now his house has been blown apart! Oh, I hope they don’t kill him! That’s why I wanted the Death Eaters to get a glimpse of Harry before we left, so they knew Xenophilius hadn’t been lying! You’re supposed to be in bed with spattergroit, Ron! They’ve kidnapped Luna because her father supported Harry! What would happen to your family if they knew you’re with him? They’re in Australia, They should be all right. They don’t know anything. What about Luna? Don’t say that, don’t say it! She must be alive, she must! Oh, why did we go there? Harry, you were right, it was Godric’s Hollow all over again, a complete waste of time!  The Deathly Hallows .. . such rubbish . . . although actually, he might have made it all up, mightn’t he? He probably doesn’t believe in the Deathly Hallows at all, he just wanted to keep us talking until the Death Eaters arrived! Well, I don’t suppose it matters, Even if he was being honest, I never heard such a lot of nonsense in all my life. But the Deathly Hallows can’t exist, Ron! ‘The Tale of the Three Brothers’ is a story, A story about how humans are frightened of death. If surviving was as simple as hiding under the Invisibility Cloak, we’d have everything we need already! There’s no such thing, Harry! All right, even if you want to kid yourself the Elder Wand’s real, what about the Resurrection Stone? No magic can raise the dead, and that’s that! But they weren’t really back from the dead, were they? Those kinds of — of pale imitations aren’t the same as truly bringing someone back to life. No, I looked him up after I saw the mark on his grave; if he’d been anyone famous or done anything important, I’m sure he’d be in one of our books. The only place I’ve managed to find the name ‘Peverell’ is Nature’s Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. I borrowed it from Kreacher, It lists the pure-blood families that are now extinct in the male line. Apparently the Peverells were one of the earliest families to vanish. The Peverell coat of arms? Could you see what it looked like? Yes . . . and that’s all very interesting, but Harry, if you’re thinking what I think you’re think — Harry, A minute ago you told us you never saw the mark on the stone properly! Harry? Harry, Harry, I’m sorry, but I think you’ve got this wrong, all wrong. Sorry? It doesn’t, Harry, you’re just getting carried away. Please, please just answer me this: If the Deathly Hallows really existed, and Dumbledore knew about them, knew that the person who possessed all three of them would be master of Death — Harry, why wouldn’t he have told you? Why? But I only said that to try and persuade you to come to the Lovegoods’! I didn’t really believe it! Harry, This is the real thing, and Dumbledore left you very clear instructions: Find and destroy the Horcruxes! That symbol doesn’t mean anything, forget the Deathly Hallows, we can’t afford to get sidetracked — Thank you, Ron, I’ll take first watch. But that’s Lee Jordan! Shh! We know! We know it’s Lupin! And I’d tell him to follow his instincts, which are good and nearly always right. Nearly always right, It’s so brave of them, If they were found . . . Harry — Harry, No! Leave him alone, leave him alone! Penelope Clearwater, Half-blood, It isn’t! It isn’t me! We found it — we found it — PLEASE! We only met him tonight! We’ve never been inside your vault. . . . It isn’t the real sword! It’s a copy, just a copy! Harry — said Hermione, but she was cut off by Griphook. We do! We protest! And I’m hunted quite as much as any goblin or elf, Griphook! I’m a Mudblood! Why shouldn’t I? Mudblood, and proud of it! I’ve got no higher position under this new order than you have, Griphook! It was me they chose to torture, back at the Malfoys’! Did you know that it was Harry who set Dobby free? Did you know that we’ve wanted elves to be freed for years? You can’t want You-Know-Who defeated more than we do, Griphook! Harry, are you saying what I think you’re saying? Are you saying there’s a Horcrux in the Lestranges’ vault? No, He can’t know that, Harry, how could he — ? So you — you don’t think it can be a fairy tale or a myth? I don’t know, Goblins have got good reason to dislike wizards, Ron, They’ve been treated brutally in the past. But arguing with Griphook about whose race is most underhanded and violent isn’t going to make him more likely to help us, is it? Ron, he’d know the difference better than we would! He’s the only one who realized there had been a swap! That,is despicable.  Ask for his help, then double-cross him? And you wonder why goblins don’t like wizards, Ron? We need to offer him something else, something just as valuable. Does it make a difference? Harry, we can’t — But that could be years! I don’t like it, There’s really only enough left for one of us, Luna, we told you, That horn exploded. It came from an Erumpent, not a Crumple-Horned Snorkack — Wha — ? Tonks — Tonks has had the baby? I hate this thing, I really hate it. It feels all wrong, it doesn’t work properly for me. . . . It’s like a bit of her. But that’s my point! This is the wand that tortured Neville’s mum and dad, and who knows how many other people? This is the wand that killed Sirius! I miss my wand, I wish Mr. Ollivander could have made me another one too. She tasted disgusting, worse than Gurdyroots! Okay, Ron, come here so I can do you. . . . Oh, for heaven’s sake, this isn’t about looking handsome — There, how does he look, Harry? Good morning, Okay, okay! I wish to enter my vault, Identification? I — I have never been asked for identification before! What? No, no, that’s mine — If we can, What? C-Cushioning Charm, Harry, I think I can hear people coming! Protego! Harry, could this be — ? Aargh! It burned me! Stand still, don’t move! Accio Cup! Levicorpus. Impervius! What? We’ll never get out, it’s too big! What’ll happen to it, do you think? Will it be all right? What do you mean? What are we going to do, though? He’ll know, won’t he? You-Know-Who will know we know about his Horcruxes! Wait, wait! We can’t just go, we haven’t got a plan, we need to — But how are we going to get in? But we don’t really fit — Let’s just leave! Disapparate now! Mr. Dumbledore? Is that your sister? Ariana? Professor Dumbledore cared about Harry, very much, What do you mean? But that’s a really serious thing to say! Are you — are you talking about your sister? I’m so . . . I’m so sorry, I don’t believe it. Dumbledore loved Harry, I think Ron’s right. We don’t even know what we’re looking for, we need them. You don’t have to do everything alone, Harry. It was Ron, all Ron’s idea! Wasn’t it absolutely brilliant? after you left, and I said to Ron, even if we find the other one, how are we going to get rid of it? We still hadn’t got rid of the cup! And then he thought of it! The basilisk! He did! Show him, Ron! He was amazing! Amazing! Who’s the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower? Accio Diadem! Harry! What can we do? What can we do? What? Let’s stick together. I say we go — Harry, what’s that on your arm? What? It must have been Fiendfyre! But don’t you realize? This means, if we can just get the snake — Voldemort’s sitting in the Shrieking Shack? He’s not — he’s not even fighting? But why? No, Ron, I’m just as capable — Oh my — ! Crookshanks? Are you a wizard, or what? Perfect! The Cloak! Put the Cloak on! I think Harry’s right,",

No need to ask who you are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford.” You’ll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don’t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.” “Unless you’re a bit politer you’ll go the same way as your parents. They didn’t know what was good for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it’ll rub off on you.” “Oh, you’re going to fight us, are you?” “But we don’t feel like leaving, do we, boys? We’ve eaten all our food and you still seem to have some.” Just looking, I think I’ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find — how about — up a tree? Come and get it, Potter! Oh, yeah? Catch it if you can, then! Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the Muggles? I’d take you on anytime on my own, Tonight, if you want. Wizard’s duel. Wands only — no contact. What’s the matter? Never heard of a wizard’s duel before, I suppose? Crabbe, Midnight all right? We’ll meet you in the trophy room; that’s always unlocked. That’s a broomstick, You’ll be in for it this time, Potter, first years aren’t allowed them. What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn’t afford half the handle, I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig. Potter’s been sent a broomstick, Professor, Would you mind moving out of the way? “Wonder how long Potter’s going to stay on his broom this time? Anyone want a bet? What about you, Weasley?” Longbottom, if brains were gold you’d be poorer than Weasley, and that’s saying something. You’re in luck, Weasley, Potter’s obviously spotted some money on the ground! “You don’t understand, Professor. Harry Potter’s coming — he’s got a dragon!” “I’m not going in that forest,” “But this is servant stuff, it’s not for students to do. I thought we’d be copying lines or something, if my father knew I was doing this, he’d —” And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?” “I want Fang,” “AAAAAAAAAAARGH!” I’m the new Slytherin Seeker, Weasley, Everyone’s just been admiring the brooms my father’s bought our team. Good, aren’t they? But perhaps the Gryffindor team will be able to raise some gold and get new brooms, too. You could raffle off those Cleansweep Fives; I expect a museum would bid for them. No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood, All right there, Scarhead? Training for the ballet, Potter? “What the —” “Tarantallegra!” Scared? There you are, Have you two been pigging out in the Great Hall all this time? I’ve been looking for you; I want to show you something really funny. And what’re you doing down here, Weasley?  That Peter Weasley — Whatever, I’ve noticed him sneaking around a lot lately. And I bet I know what he’s up to. He thinks he’s going to catch Slytherin’s heir single-handed. What’s the new password again? Oh, yeah — pure-blood! Wait here, I’ll go and get it — my father’s just sent it to me —  “That’ll give you a laugh,” “Arthur Weasley loves Muggles so much he should snap his wand in half and go and join them,” You’d never know the Weasleys were purebloods, the way they behave. “What’s up with you, Crabbe?” ‘Potter, can I have your picture, Potter? Can I have your autograph? Can I lick your shoes, please, Potter?’” “What’s going on here?” “Wonder what Potter’s written in this?” “When I’ve had a look,” “I don’t think Potter liked your valentine much!” Well, look who it is, Potty and the Weasel. I heard your father finally got his hands on some gold this summer, Weasley, Did your mother die of shock? Who’s that? “C’mon,” How? How do we open our books? Oh, how silly we’ve all been! We should have stroked them! Why didn’t we guess! Oh, tremendously funny! Really witty, giving us books that try and rip our hands off! God, this place is going to the dogs, That oaf teaching classes, my father’ll have a fit when I tell him — Careful, Potter, there’s a dementor behind you — This is very easy, I’m dying! I’m dying, look at me! It’s killed me! Yeah, Sir, sir, I’ll need help cutting up these daisy roots, because of my arm — Weasley, you heard Professor Snape; cut up these roots. Professor, Weasley’s mutilating my roots, sir. Sir, Seen your pal Hagrid lately? — he’s complained to the school governors. And to the Ministry of Magic. Father’s got a lot of influence, you know. And a lasting injury like this who knows if my arm’ll ever be the same again? Well, partly, Potter. But there are other benefits too. Weasley, slice my caterpillars for me. Thinking of trying to catch Black single-handed, Potter? Of course, if it was me, I’d have done something before now. I wouldn’t be staying in school like a good boy, I’d be out there looking for him. Don’t you know, Potter? Maybe you’d rather not risk your neck, Want to leave it to the dementors, do you? But if it was me, I’d want revenge. I’d hunt him down myself. Sure you can manage that broom, Potter? Got plenty of special features, hasn’t it? . . . should have an owl from Father any time now. He had to go to the hearing to tell them about my arm . . . about how I couldn’t use it for three months. . . . I really wish I could hear that great hairy moron trying to defend himself . . . ‘There’s no ’arm in ’im, ’onest —’ . . . that hippogriff’s as good as dead — What are you doing, Weasley? Suppose you’d love to live here, wouldn’t you, Weasley? Dreaming about having your own bedroom? I heard your family all sleep in one room — is that true? We were just discussing your friend Hagrid, Just trying to imagine what he’s saying to the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures. D’you think he’ll cry when they cut off his hippogriff’s — What the — ? What was that? Who did that? It came from over there! AAARGH! Get out of it, Potter! Well, with feet that size, hard not to, Language, Weasley, Hadn’t you better be hurrying along, now? You wouldn’t like her spotted, would you? Granger, they’re after Muggles, D’you want to be showing off your knickers in midair? Because if you do, hang around . . . they’re moving this way, and it would give us all a laugh. Have it your own way, Potter, If you think they can’t spot a Mudblood, stay where you are. Scare easily, don’t they? I suppose your daddy told you all to hide? What’s he up to — trying to rescue the Muggles? Well . . . if they were, I wouldn’t be likely to tell you, would I, Potter? Keep that big bushy head down, Granger, . . . Father actually considered sending me to Durmstrang rather than Hogwarts, you know. He knows the headmaster, you see. Well, you know his opinion of Dumbledore — the man’s such a Mudblood-lover — and Durmstrang doesn’t admit that sort of riffraff. But Mother didn’t like the idea of me going to school so far away. Father says Durmstrang takes a far more sensible line than Hogwarts about the Dark Arts. Durmstrang students actually learn them, not just the defense rubbish we do. . . . For the first and last time in your life, Weasley. Weasley . . . what is that? Look at this! Weasley, you weren’t thinking of wearing these, were you? I mean — they were very fashionable in about 1890. . . . So . . . going to enter, Weasley? Going to try and bring a bit of glory to the family name? There’s money involved as well, you know . . . you’d be able to afford some decent robes if you won. . . . Are you going to enter? I suppose you will, Potter? You never miss a chance to show off, do you? Yes, You’ve got a father and brother at the Ministry and you don’t even know? My God, my father told me about it ages ago . . . heard it from Cornelius Fudge.  But then, Father’s always associated with the top people at the Ministry. . . . Maybe your father’s too junior to know about it, Weasley . . . yes . . . they probably don’t talk about important stuff in front of him. Weasley! Hey, Weasley! Weasley! Listen to this! Imagine them not even getting his name right, Weasley. It’s almost as though he’s a complete nonentity, isn’t it? Weasley! A picture of your parents outside their house — if you can call it a house! Your mother could do with losing a bit of weight, couldn’t she? Oh yeah, you were staying with them this summer, weren’t you, Potter? So tell me, is his mother really that porky, or is it just the picture? Don’t you dare insult my mother, Potter. my father Yes, Like them, Potter? And this isn’t all they do — look! Want one, Granger? I’ve got loads. But don’t touch my hand, now. I’ve just washed it, you see; don’t want a Mudblood sliming it up. Densaugeo! Potter attacked me, sir — — and he hit Goyle — look — “There you go,” “Hate to break it to you, Potter. . . .” got a bad bite off a flobberworm,”  I was just having some fun,” “Well, I think this should put an end to the oaf’s teaching career,”  “Half-giant . . . and there was me thinking he’d just swallowed a bottle of Skele-Gro when he was young. . . . None of the mummies and daddies are going to like this at all. . . . They’ll be worried he’ll eat their kids, ha, ha. . . .” “Hey, Potter! Potter! How’s your head? You feeling all right? Sure you’re not going to go berserk on us?”  they saw him lose his temper at a dueling club and set a snake on another boy. It was all hushed up, though. Very clever, Granger, So, You caught some pathetic reporter, and Potter’s Dumbledore’s favorite boy again. Big deal. Trying not to think about it, are we? Trying to pretend it hasn’t happened? Manners, Potter, or I’ll have to give you a detention, You see, I, unlike you, have been made a prefect, which means that I, unlike you, have the power to hand out punishments. Tell me, how does it feel being second-best to Weasley, Potter? I seem to have touched a nerve, Well, just watch yourself, Potter, because I’ll be dogging your footsteps in case you step out of line. Maybe, the stupid great oaf’s got himself badly injured. Maybe he’s been messing with stuff that’s too big for him, if you get my drift. Yes, Father was talking to the Minister just a couple of days ago, you know, and it sounds as though the Ministry’s really determined to crack down on substandard teaching in this place. So even if that overgrown moron does show up again, he’ll probably be sent packing straight away. What’s that Weasley’s riding? Why would anyone put a Flying Charm on a moldy old log like that? Hey, Potter, how’s your scar feeling? Sure you don’t need a lie-down? It must be, what, a whole week since you were in the hospital wing, that’s a record for you, isn’t it? Some people got D’s? Ha! That was me, I was slashed by a hippogriff. Yeah, Umbridge gave the Slytherin Quidditch team permission to continue playing straightaway, I went to ask her first thing this morning. Well, it was pretty much automatic, I mean, she knows my father really well, he’s always popping in and out of the Ministry. . . . It’ll be interesting to see whether Gryffindor are allowed to keep playing, won’t it? I mean, if it’s a question of influence with the Ministry, I don’t think they’ve got much chance. . . . From what my father says, they’ve been looking for an excuse to sack Arthur Weasley for years. . . . And as for Potter . . . My father says it’s a matter of time before the Ministry has him carted off to St. Mungo’s. . . . apparently they’ve got a special ward for people whose brains have been addled by magic . . . Saved Weasley’s neck, haven’t you? I’ve never seen a worse Keeper . . . but then he was born in a bin. . . . Did you like my lyrics, Potter? — we couldn’t fit in useless loser either — for his father, — but you like the Weasleys, don’t you, Potter? Spend holidays there and everything, don’t you? Can’t see how you stand the stink, but I suppose when you’ve been dragged up by Muggles even the Weasleys’ hovel smells okay — Or perhaps, you can remember what your mother’s house stank like, Potter, and Weasley’s pigsty reminds you of it — Excuse me, but what exactly are we supposed to be seeing? Assuming they can understand you, of course, Yeah, Weasley, we were just wondering, D’you reckon if you saw someone snuff it you’d be able to see the Quaffle better? Trip Jinx, Potter! Hey, Professor — PROFESSOR! I’ve got one! Now, do you really want to finish that sentence, Granger? Afraid I’m going to have to dock a few points from Gryffindor and Hufflepuff, I know prefects can’t dock points from each other, But members of the Inquisitorial Squad — The Inquisitorial Squad, Granger, A select group of students who are supportive of the Ministry of Magic, hand-picked by Professor Umbridge. Anyway, members of the Inquisitorial Squad do have the power to dock points. . . . So, Granger, I’ll have five from you for being rude about our new headmistress. . . . Macmillan, five for contradicting me. . . . Five because I don’t like you, Potter . . . Weasley, your shirt’s untucked, so I’ll have another five for that. . . . Oh yeah, I forgot, you’re a Mudblood, Granger, so ten for that . . . Wise move, Granger, New Head, new times . . . Be good now, Potty . . . Weasel King . . . Professor Snape, sir — oh — sorry — I didn’t know, It’s Professor Umbridge, sir — she needs your help, They’ve found Montague, sir. He’s turned up jammed inside a toilet on the fourth floor. I don’t know, sir, he’s a bit confused . . . Remedial Potions? Professor, Professor Umbridge, I think some of the squad should come with you to look after — All right, You’re dead, Potter. You’re going to pay, I’m going to make you pay for what you’ve done to my father . . . You think you’re such a big man, Potter, You wait. I’ll have you. You can’t land my father in prison — The dementors have left Azkaban, Dad and the others’ll be out in no time . . . Don’t you dare talk to my mother like that, Potter! Ouch! Watch where you’re putting your pins, woman! Mother — I don’t think I want these anymore — Sir, I think you knew my grandfather, Abraxas Malfoy? All right, I wasn’t invited! I was trying to gate-crash, happy? He always spoke very highly of you, sir, Said you were the best potion-maker he’d ever known. . . . I don’t know how much longer, all right? It’s taking longer than I thought it would. Look, it’s none of your business what I’m doing, Crabbe, you and Goyle just do as you’re told and keep a lookout! What do you mean, ‘something amusing’? No one can help me, I can’t do it. . . . I can’t. . . . It won’t work . . . and unless I do it soon . . . he says he’ll kill me. . . . Cruci — And you, Potter . . . You wait here for me. Stand back. Line up against the back wall. Don’t try anything, or I’ll kill you! Hold it, Potter. That’s my wand you’re holding, Potter, My mother, I virtually lived in the Room of Hidden Things all last year, I know how to get in. No! If you wreck the room you might bury this diadem thing! Potter came in here to get it, STOP! It’s that Mudblood! Avada Kedavra! Don’t kill him! DON’T KILL HIM! RUN! The door, get to the door, the door! What? C-Crabbe, C-Crabbe . . . I’m Draco Malfoy, I’m Draco, I’m on your side!",

Finch-Fletchley, Justin! Granger, Hermione! “Potter, Harry!” What’s going on? HARRY POTTER! Never — in all my time at Hogwarts —  — how dare you — might have broken your neck — Be quiet, Miss Patil — That’s enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now. JORDAN! JORDAN! “Jordan, I’m warning you —” What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Come on — I shall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy! I would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Filch says you were up in the Astronomy Tower. It’s one o’clock in the morning. Explain yourselves. I think I’ve got a good idea of what’s been going on, It doesn’t take a genius to work it out. You fed Draco Malfoy some cock-and-bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bed and into trouble. I’ve already caught him. I suppose you think it’s funny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed it, too? I’m disgusted, Four students out of bed in one night! I’ve never heard of such a thing before! You, Miss Granger, I thought you had more sense. As for you, Mr. Potter, I thought Gryffindor meant more to you than this. All three of you will receive detentions — yes, you too, Mr. Longbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night, especially these days, it’s very dangerous — and fifty points will be taken from Gryffindor. Fifty points each, Don’t tell me what I can and can’t do, Potter. Now get back to bed, all of you. “What are you three doing inside?” “Why?” “Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many demands on his time —” “Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter?” “How do you know — ?” I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine.” “Innocent until proven guilty, Severus,” This way, Potter, This is out of my hands, Potter, Lemon drop! “Potter! Weasley! What are you doing?” Very well, so you found out where the entrance was — breaking a hundred school rules into pieces along the way, I might add — but how on earth did you all get out of there alive, Potter? Professor Lupin sent an owl ahead to say that you were taken ill on the train, Potter. A dementor, Are you sure you feel all right, Potter? Very well. Kindly wait outside while I have a quick word with Miss Granger about her course schedule, then we can go down to the feast together. There’s no point hiding it from you any longer, Potter, I know this will come as a shock to you, but Sirius Black — I see! Well, in that case, Potter, you’ll understand why I don’t think it’s a good idea for you to be practicing Quidditch in the evenings. Out on the field with only your team members, it’s very exposed, Potter — Hmm . . . Well . . . goodness knows, I’d like to see us win the Cup at last . . . but all the same, Potter . . . I’d be happier if a teacher were present. I’ll ask Madam Hooch to oversee your training sessions. We’ll risk it, Sybill, Do sit down, the turkey’s getting stone cold. Tripe, Sybill? But surely you already knew that, Sybill? That explains a great deal, Imagine that, I doubt it will make much difference, unless a mad axe-man is waiting outside the doors to slaughter the first into the entrance hall. So that’s it, is it? Miss Granger has just informed me that you have been sent a broomstick, Potter. May I? Hmm. And there was no note at all, Potter? No card? No message of any kind? Well, Well, I’m afraid I will have to take this, Potter. It will need to be checked for jinxes, Of course, I’m no expert, but I daresay Madam Hooch and Professor Flitwick will strip it down — It shouldn’t take more than a few weeks, You will have it back if we are sure it is jinx-free. I doubt, I shall keep you informed. No, Potter, you can’t have it back yet, We’ve checked for most of the usual curses, but Professor Flitwick believes the broom might be carrying a Hurling Hex. I shall tell you once we’ve finished checking it. Now, please stop badgering me. Do watch where you’re going, Potter! I’ve just been looking for you in the Gryffindor common room. Well, here it is, we’ve done everything we could think of, and there doesn’t seem to be anything wrong with it at all. You’ve got a very good friend somewhere, Potter. . . . Ah, Jordan, would you mind telling us what’s going on in the match? Jordan! Jordan! ARE YOU BEING PAID TO ADVERTISE FIREBOLTS? GET ON WITH THE COMMENTARY! An unworthy trick! A low and cowardly attempt to sabotage the Gryffindor Seeker! Detention for all of you, and fifty points from Slytherin! I shall be speaking to Professor Dumbledore about this, make no mistake! Ah, here he comes now! I am delighted that Gryffindor won the match, but this is getting ridiculous! Percy, I expected better of you! “Don’t be ridiculous, Weasley, how could he possibly have gotten through the portrait hole?” “Sir Cadogan, did you just let a man enter Gryffindor Tower?” You — you did? But — but the password! “Jordan, if you can’t commentate in an unbiased way — !” When I call out your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool, When the hat announces your House, you will go and sit at the appropriate table. Professor Moody! The what? Teach — Moody, is that a student? No! Moody, we never use Transfiguration as a punishment! Surely Professor Dumbledore told you that? We give detentions, Moody! Or speak to the offender’s Head of House! You are now entering a most important phase of your magical education! Maybe not, Thomas, but believe me, you need all the preparation you can get! Miss Granger remains the only person in this class who has managed to turn a hedgehog into a satisfactory pincushion. I might remind you that your pincushion, Thomas, still curls up in fright if anyone approaches it with a pin! Weasley, straighten your hat, Miss Patil, take that ridiculous thing out of your hair. Follow me, please, First years in front . . . no pushing. . . . Dumbledore, you know perfectly well you did not make a mistake! Really, what nonsense! Harry could not have crossed the line himself, and as Professor Dumbledore believes that he did not persuade an older student to do it for him, I’m sure that should be good enough for everybody else! Potter, the champions have to come down onto the grounds now. . . . You have to get ready for your first task. Now, don’t panic, just keep a cool head. . . . We’ve got wizards standing by to control the situation if it gets out of hand. . . . The main thing is just to do your best, and nobody will think any the worse of you. . . . Are you all right? You’re to go in here with the other champions, and wait for your turn, Potter. Mr. Bagman is in there . . . he’ll be telling you the — the procedure. . . . Good luck. That was excellent, Potter! You’ll need to see Madam Pomfrey before the judges give out your score. . . . Over there, she’s had to mop up Diggory already. . . . Right then, Potter, the first aid tent, please . . . Champions over here, please! “Potter, the champions are congregating in the chamber off the Hall after breakfast,” We are going to be patrolling the outside of the maze, If you get into difficulty, and wish to be rescued, send red sparks into the air, and one of us will come and get you, do you understand? Come along, Potter, Come along . . . hospital wing . . . There is no need to stand guard over him anymore, Dumbledore! The Minister has seen to that! I told him you would not agree, Dumbledore! I told him you would never allow dementors to set foot inside the castle, but — You fool! Mr. Crouch! These deaths were not the random work of a lunatic! Abercrombie, Euan. What on earth are you shouting about, Potter? Why aren’t you in class? Sent? What do you mean, sent? Come in here, Potter. Well? Is this true? Is it true that you shouted at Professor Umbridge? You called her a liar? You told her He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back? Have a biscuit, Potter. Have a biscuit, And sit down. Potter, you need to be careful. Misbehavior in Dolores Umbridge’s class could cost you much more than House points and a detention. Potter, use your common sense, You know where she comes from, you must know to whom she is reporting. It says here she’s given you detention every evening this week, starting tomorrow, No, I couldn’t, She is your teacher and has every right to give you detention. You will go to her room at five o’clock tomorrow for the first one. Just remember: Tread carefully around Dolores Umbridge. For heaven’s sake, Potter! Do you really think this is about truth or lies? It’s about keeping your head down and your temper under control! Have another biscuit, Don’t be ridiculous, Didn’t you listen to Dolores Umbridge’s speech at the start-of-term feast, Potter? “Well, I’m glad you listen to Hermione Granger at any rate,” Miss Johnson, how dare you make such a racket in the Great Hall! Five points from Gryffindor! What’s this, Potter? Detention? From whom? Are you telling me, that after the warning I gave you last Monday you lost your temper in Professor Umbridge’s class again? Potter, you must get a grip on yourself! You are heading for serious trouble! Another five points from Gryffindor! Because detentions do not appear to have any effect on you whatsoever! No, not another word of complaint, Potter! And as for you, Miss Johnson, you will confine your shouting matches to the Quidditch pitch in future or risk losing the team Captaincy! That will do, That will do, Mr. Finnigan, kindly come here and hand back the homework — Miss Brown, please take this box of mice — don’t be silly, girl, they won’t hurt you — and hand one to each student — That will do, Today we shall be — Yes? Obviously I received it, or I would have asked you what you are doing in my classroom, I wonder, how you expect to gain an idea of my usual teaching methods if you continue to interrupt me? As I was saying, the Vanishing Spell becomes more difficult with the complexity of the animal to be vanished. The snail, as an invertebrate, does not present much of a challenge; the mouse, as a mammal, offers a much greater one. This is not, therefore, magic you can accomplish with your mind on your dinner. So — you know the incantation, let me see what you can do . . . Thirty-nine years this December, I can hardly wait, Hurry up, you three, You haven’t been given another detention! Well then, why are you out of class? Do you know how far this owl’s traveled, Potter? Potter’s letter! Potter! Bear in mind, that channels of communication in and out of Hogwarts may be being watched, won’t you? I think you’ve got enough to be getting on with at the moment, I’ve become accustomed to seeing the Quidditch Cup in my study, boys, and I really don’t want to have to hand it over to Professor Snape, so use the extra time to practice, won’t you? JORDAN! In! Well? I have never seen such a disgraceful exhibition. Two onto one! Explain yourselves! Provoked you? He’d just lost, hadn’t he, of course he wanted to provoke you! But what on earth he can have said that justified what you two — But instead of leaving it to Madam Hooch to sort out, you two decided to give an exhibition of Muggle dueling, did you? Have you any idea what you’ve — ? Help? What do you mean, ‘help’? You thought wrong, Now, you two had better listen closely. Do not look at me like that, Potter, you deserve it! And if either of you ever — Yes? But unfortunately, it is what I think that counts, as they are in my House, Dolores. Not another one! What is it, Potter? Where does it hurt? What do you mean, you saw it happen? You mean you dreamed this? Professor Dumbledore, Potter has had a . . . well, a nightmare, He says . . . Very well, then, Potter, you tell the headmaster about it. And what is your evidence for that? Oh, so that’s why he wasn’t prosecuted for setting up all those regurgitating toilets! What an interesting insight into our justice system! I would have thought her meaning was quite clear, There have been no secret meetings for the past six months. Is that correct, Miss Edgecombe? Well, they mean ‘no. ’ So unless Miss Edgecombe is using a form of sign language as yet unknown to humans — He will not be single-handed! Yes! Ah, Grimmauld Place? You think so, do you? Dear, dear, Miss Brown, would you mind running along to the headmistress and informing her that we have an escaped firework in our classroom? No matter, Potter, Sit down, Potter, What? Have you had any thoughts about what you would like to do after you leave Hogwarts? Yes? You’d need top grades for that, They ask for a minimum of five N. E.W.T.s, and nothing under ‘Exceeds Expectations’ grade, I see. Then you would be required to undergo a stringent series of character and aptitude tests at the Auror office. It’s a difficult career path, Potter; they only take the best. In fact, I don’t think anybody has been taken on in the last three years. You’ll want to know which subjects you ought to take, I suppose? Naturally, Yes, And I ought to tell you now, Potter, that I do not accept students into my N. E.W.T. classes unless they have achieved ‘Exceeds Expectations’ or higher at Ordinary Wizarding Level. I’d say you’re averaging ‘Acceptable’ at the moment, so you’ll need to put in some good hard work before the exams to stand a chance of continuing. Then you ought to do Charms, always useful, and Potions. Yes, Potter, Potions, Poisons and antidotes are essential study for Aurors. And I must tell you that Professor Snape absolutely refuses to take students who get anything other than ‘Outstanding’ in their O. W.L.s, so — May I offer you a cough drop, Dolores? I daresay you’ll find you can, Were you? Well, Potter, if you are serious in this ambition, I would advise you to concentrate hard on bringing your Transfiguration and Potions up to scratch. I see Professor Flitwick has graded you between ‘Acceptable’ and ‘Exceeds Expectations’ for the last two years, so your Charm work seems satisfactory; as for Defense Against the Dark Arts, your marks have been generally high, Professor Lupin in particular thought you — are you quite sure you wouldn’t like a cough drop, Dolores? What, this thing? Yes, as I was saying, Potter, Professor Lupin thought you showed a pronounced aptitude for the subject, and obviously for an Auror — Of course I understood it, False hope? I should have made my meaning plainer, He has achieved high marks in all Defense Against the Dark Arts tests set by a competent teacher. Any questions, Potter? Well, you’ll need to demonstrate the ability to react well to pressure and so forth, perseverance and dedication, because Auror training takes a further three years, not to mention very high skills in practical defense. It will mean a lot more study even after you’ve left school, so unless you’re prepared to — — unless you’re prepared to take even more exams after Hogwarts, you should really look at another — A very good chance, then, Potter has been cleared of all charges, Potter, I will assist you to become an Auror if it is the last thing I do! If I have to coach you nightly I will make sure you achieve the required results! There may well be a new Minister of Magic by the time Potter is ready to join! It’s over, Potter, that concludes our career consultation. As you can see, your O.W.L. s are spread over two successive weeks. You will sit the theory exams in the mornings and the practice in the afternoons. Your practical Astronomy examination will, of course, take place at night. Now, I must warn you that the most stringent Anti-Cheating Charms have been applied to your examination papers. Auto-Answer Quills are banned from the examination hall, as are Remembralls, Detachable Cribbing Cuffs, and Self-Correcting Ink. Every year, I am afraid to say, seems to harbor at least one student who thinks that he or she can get around the Wizarding Examinations Authority’s rules. I can only hope that it is nobody in Gryffindor. Our new — headmistress has asked the Heads of House to tell their students that cheating will be punished most severely — because, of course, your examination results will reflect upon the headmistress’s new regime at the school . . . However, that is no reason not to do your very best. You have your own futures to think about. An owl will be sent to you some time in July, Add some more? Yes, Professor Snape, I’m quite as good as new. You two — Crabbe — Goyle — Here, take these up to my office for me. Right then, What say you, Professor Snape? So that’s fifty each for Potter, the two Weasleys, Longbottom, and Miss Granger, Oh — and fifty for Miss Lovegood, I suppose, Now, you wanted to take ten from Mr. Potter, I think, Professor Snape — so there we are . . . Well, Potter, Malfoy, I think you ought to be outside on a glorious day like this, Herbology, fine, Professor Sprout will be delighted to see you back with an ‘Outstanding’ O. W.L. And you qualify for Defense Against the Dark Arts with ‘Exceeds Expectations. ’ But the problem is Transfiguration. I’m sorry, Longbottom, but an ‘Acceptable’ really isn’t good enough to continue to N. E.W.T. level. I just don’t think you’d be able to cope with the coursework. Why do you want to continue with Transfiguration, anyway? I’ve never had the impression that you particularly enjoyed it. Hmph, It’s high time your grandmother learned to be proud of the grandson she’s got, rather than the one she thinks she ought to have — particularly after what happened at the Ministry. I’m sorry, Longbottom, but I cannot let you into my N. E.W.T. class. I see that you have an ‘Exceeds Expectations’ in Charms, however — why not try for a N. E.W.T. in Charms? Take Charms, and I shall drop Augusta a line reminding her that just because she failed her Charms O. W.L., the subject is not necessarily worthless. He and Professor Trelawney are dividing classes between them this year, The sixth year is being taken by Professor Trelawney. So, Potter, Potter Charms, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Herbology, Transfiguration . . . all fine. I must say, I was pleased with your Transfiguration mark, Potter, very pleased. Now, why haven’t you applied to continue with Potions? I thought it was your ambition to become an Auror? And so you did when Professor Snape was teaching the subject. Professor Slughorn, however, is perfectly happy to accept N. E.W.T. students with ‘Exceeds Expectations’ at O.W.L. Do you wish to proceed with Potions? I’m sure Professor Slughorn will be able to lend you some, Very well, Potter, here is your schedule. Oh, by the way — twenty hopefuls have already put down their names for the Gryffindor Quidditch team. I shall pass the list to you in due course and you can fix up trials at your leisure. Hagrid says you four saw what happened to Katie Bell — upstairs to my office at once, please! What’s that you’re holding, Potter? Good lord, No, no, Filch, they’re with me! Take this necklace to Professor Snape at once, but be sure not to touch it, keep it wrapped in the scarf! Well? What happened? All right, go up to the hospital wing, please, Leanne, and get Madam Pomfrey to give you something for shock. What? The headmaster is away until Monday, Potter, Yes, But anything you have to say about this horrible business can be said to me, I’m sure! That is a very serious accusation, Potter, Do you have any proof? Malfoy took something to Borgin and Burkes for repair? You saw Malfoy leaving the shop with a similar package? That’s enough! Potter, I appreciate you telling me this, but we cannot point the finger of blame at Mr. Malfoy purely because he visited the shop where this necklace might have been purchased. The same is probably true of hundreds of people — And also, — and what is more, Mr. Malfoy was not in Hogsmeade today. All right, He has now failed to complete his Transfiguration homework twice in a row. So, thank you for telling me your suspicions, Potter, but I need to go up to the hospital wing now to check on Katie Bell. Good day to you all. Evening, Potter. Try not to get too much ash on the carpet. Malfoy, be quiet and pay attention! It’s Cadwallader! Seventy-forty to Hufflepuff! Take that! Molly and Arthur are on their way, Harry, what happened? According to Hagrid you were with Professor Dumbledore when he — when it happened. He says Professor Snape was involved in some — He always hinted that he had an ironclad reason for trusting Snape, I mean . . . with Snape’s history . . . of course people were bound to wonder . . . but Dumbledore told me explicitly that Snape’s repentance was absolutely genuine. . . . Wouldn’t hear a word against him! This is all my fault, My fault. I sent Filius to fetch Snape tonight, I actually sent for him to come and help us! If I hadn’t alerted Snape to what was going on, he might never have joined forces with the Death Eaters. I don’t think he knew they were there before Filius told him, I don’t think he knew they were coming. I don’t know exactly how it happened, It’s all so confusing. . . . Dumbledore had told us that he would be leaving the school for a few hours and that we were to patrol the corridors just in case . . . Remus, Bill, and Nymphadora were to join us .. . and so we patrolled.   All seemed quiet. Every secret passageway out of the school was covered. We knew nobody could fly in. There were powerful enchantments on every entrance into the castle. I still don’t know how the Death Eaters can possibly have entered. . . . He must have known a spell we didn’t, After all — he was the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. . . . I just assumed that he was in a hurry to chase after the Death Eaters who’d escaped up to the tower. . . . We don’t yet know, Dumbledore would have been happier than anybody to think that there was a little more love in the world, Thank you, I shall have to see the Ministry when they get here. Hagrid, please tell the Heads of Houses — Slughorn can represent Slytherin — that I want to see them in my office forthwith. I would like you to join us too. Before I meet them I would like a quick word with you, Harry. If you’ll come with me. . . . Harry, I would like to know what you and Professor Dumbledore were doing this evening when you left the school. Harry, Potter — Harry registered the renewed use of his surname —in the light of Professor Dumbledore’s death, I think you must see that the situation has changed somewhat — But — Rosmerta? Thank you, I want to talk about what happens to Hogwarts before he gets here, Personally, I am not convinced that the school should reopen next year. The death of the headmaster at the hands of one of our colleagues is a terrible stain upon Hogwarts’s history. It is horrible. I agree, And in any case, it is not true to say that Dumbledore never envisaged a situation in which Hogwarts might close. When the Chamber of Secrets reopened he considered the closure of the school — and I must say that Professor Dumbledore’s murder is more disturbing to me than the idea of Slytherin’s monster living undetected in the bowels of the castle. . . . Hagrid, you haven’t said anything, What are your views, ought Hogwarts to remain open? Professor Dumbledore always valued your views, and so do I. Very well, then I must agree with Filius that the right thing to do is to consult the governors, who will make the final decision. Now, as to getting students home . . . there is an argument for doing it sooner rather than later. We could arrange for the Hogwarts Express to come tomorrow if necessary — Well . . . I — I know that it was Dumbledore’s wish to be laid to rest here, at Hogwarts — If the Ministry thinks it appropriate, He’s coming, The Minister . . . and by the looks of it, he’s brought a delegation . . . You may, And quickly. May I ask what you are doing, Professor Carrow? But isn’t your sister in there? Didn’t Professor Flitwick let her in earlier this evening, at your urgent request? Perhaps she could open the door for you? Then you needn’t wake up half the castle. Certainly, if you wish it, Into nonbeing, which is to say, everything, She’s only Stunned, She’ll be perfectly all right. ‘Got Potter’? What do you mean, ‘got Potter’? Why would Harry Potter try to get inside Ravenclaw Tower? Potter belongs in my House! Only the difference between truth and lies, courage and cowardice, a difference, in short, which you and your sister seem unable to appreciate. But let me make one thing very clear. You are not going to pass off your many ineptitudes on the students of Hogwarts. I shall not permit it. Potter! Potter — you’re here! What — ? How — ? Potter, that was foolish! Potter, I — that was very — very gallant of you — but don’t you realize — ? You must flee, Now, Potter, as quickly as you can! The d-diadem of Ravenclaw? Of course not — hasn’t it been lost for centuries? Potter, it was madness, utter madness, for you to enter this castle — Imperio. Potter, Potter, Potter, are you all right? You’re acting on Dumbledore’s orders? We shall secure the school against He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named while you search for this — this object. I think so, we teachers are rather good at magic, you know. I am sure we will be able to hold him off for a while if we all put our best efforts into it. Of course, something will have to be done about Professor Snape — — and if Hogwarts is about to enter a state of siege, with the Dark Lord at the gates, it would indeed be advisable to take as many innocent people out of the way as possible. With the Floo Network under observation, and Apparition impossible within the grounds — Potter, There’s something in that, Come. We must alert the other Heads of House. You’d better put that Cloak back on. Who’s there? Wherever you told them to be, I expect, Severus, Really? And what gave you that impression? Oh, but naturally, You Death Eaters have your own private means of communication, I forgot. You have some objection? I thought I heard a disturbance, Coward! COWARD! He jumped, No, he’s not dead, Unlike Dumbledore, he was still carrying a wand . . . and he seems to have learned a few tricks from his master. Our headmaster is taking a short break, Very well. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is coming, Potter has work to do in the castle on Dumbledore’s orders. We need to put in place every protection of which we are capable while Potter does what he needs to do. Thank you, Pomona, I suggest we establish basic protection around the place, then gather our students and meet in the Great Hall. Most must be evacuated, though if any of those who are over age wish to stay and fight, I think they ought to be given the chance. We shall meet you and your Ravenclaws in the Great Hall, Filius! I shall expect you and the Slytherins in the Great Hall in twenty minutes, also, If you wish to leave with your students, we shall not stop you. But if any of you attempt to sabotage our resistance or take up arms against us within this castle, then, Horace, we duel to kill. The time has come for Slytherin House to decide upon its loyalties, Go and wake your students, Horace. Potter, Aren’t you supposed to be looking for something? Potter,",

How can you be nearly headless?” “How did he get covered in blood?” Harry, you need your strength, Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him? Well, they’re not — they’re not very — dangerous, are they? You’ll forgive me for saying so, my dear, but I perceive very little aura around you. Very little receptivity to the resonances of the future. Hey, Harry, have you heard? Daily Prophet this morning — they reckon Sirius Black’s been sighted. . . Riddikulus! Riddikulus! Well done, Harry!  Well done, Harry! “What’s going on?” Call this a holiday! The exams are ages away, what’re they playing at? Wonder what they’ll give us next year? Harry! Ron! Hermione! Like the decorations? The Ministry’s not too happy. Moran!” How big d’you reckon Durmstrang’s horses are going to be? We can’t have a Slytherin champion! And all the Hufflepuffs are talking about Diggory, But I wouldn’t have thought he’d have wanted to risk his good looks. Yeah, better you than Pretty-Boy Diggory, What? Someone attacking you, Harry? Nah . . . presents! Me mam didn’t want me to come back. She didn’t want me to come back to Hogwarts. Well, I suppose . . . because of you. Er . . . she . . . er . . . well, it’s not just you, it’s Dumbledore too . . .

Look — ah — it’s gone. . . . But it was definitely something hairy, Harry! Harry, Harold Dingle reckons he could sell us some firewhisky . . . Whoa! Sir, I’ve been wondering, how do you tell the difference between an Inferius and a ghost? Because there was something in the paper about an Inferius — Sir, No, It’s a proper hideout, as long as one of us stays in here, they can’t get at us, the door won’t open. It’s all down to Neville. He really gets this room. You’ve got to ask it for exactly what you need — like, ‘I don’t want any Carrow supporters to be able to get in’ — and it’ll do it for you! You’ve just got to make sure you close the loopholes! Neville’s the man! So we’ve been hiding out here for nearly two weeks, and it just makes more hammocks every time we need them, and it even sprouted a pretty good bathroom once girls started turning up — What? What?

I have a few start-of-term notices to give you. “First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.” And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song! Everyone pick their favorite tune, and off we go! Ah, music, A magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot! “So — back again, Harry?” Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you, So, you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised. But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does? And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy. I don’t need a cloak to become invisible, Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all? Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is. Does that help? Yes and no, You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of them. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that. Obviously, you’ve just done so, You may ask me one more thing, however. I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks. One can never have enough socks, Another Christmas has come and gone and I didn’t get a single pair. People will insist on giving me books. Good afternoon, Harry, Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out. Tokens from your friends and admirers, What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat.   No doubt they thought it would amuse you.Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be very hygienic, and confiscated it. Three days. I see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Stone. Professor Quirrell did not manage to take it from you.I arrived in time to prevent that, although you were doing very well on your own, I must say. We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached London than it became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left. I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you — I feared I might be too late. Not the Stone, boy, you — the effort involved nearly killed you. For one terrible moment there, I was afraid it had. As for the Stone, it has been destroyed. Oh, you know about Nicolas? You did do the thing properly, didn’t you? Well, Nicolas and I have had a little chat, and agreed it’s all for the best. To one as young as you, I’m sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long day. After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing. Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself. No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to share . . . not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. He left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies. The truth. It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case I beg you’ll forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie. Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not today. Not now. You will know, one day . . . put it from your mind for now, Harry. When you are older . . . I know you hate to hear this . . . when you are ready, you will know. Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn’t realize that love as powerful as your mother’s for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign . . . to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin. Ah — your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought you might like it. Useful things . . . your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here. Fire away. Professor Snape, Harry. Well, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike yourself and Mr. Malfoy. And then, your father did something Snape could never forgive. He saved his life. Yes . . . Funny, the way people’s minds work, isn’t it? Professor Snape couldn’t bear being in your father’s debt. . . . I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even. Then he could go back to hating your father’s memory in peace. . . . Just the one? My brain surprises even me sometimes. . . . Now, enough questions. I suggest you make a start on these sweets. Ah! Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomit-flavored one, and since then I’m afraid I’ve rather lost my liking for them — but I think I’ll be safe with a nice toffee, don’t you? Alas! Ear wax! . . . I remember something very similar happening in Ouagadogou, She’s not dead, Argus, “You may go,” About time, too, He’s been looking dreadful for days; I’ve been telling him to get a move on. Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry. Phoenixes burst into flame when it is time for them to die and are reborn from the ashes. Watch him . . . It’s a shame you had to see him on a Burning Day, Fascinating creatures, phoenixes. They can carry immensely heavy loads, their tears have healing powers, and they make highly faithful pets. No, Harry, I don’t, I, What interests me most, is how Lord Voldemort managed to enchant Ginny, when my sources tell me he is currently in hiding in the forests of Albania. Brilliant, Of course, he was probably the most brilliant student Hogwarts has ever seen. Very few people know that Lord Voldemort was once called Tom Riddle. I taught him myself, fifty years ago, at Hogwarts. He disappeared after leaving the school . . . traveled far and wide . . . sank so deeply into the Dark Arts, consorted with the very worst of our kind, underwent so many dangerous, magical transformations, that when he resurfaced as Lord Voldemort, he was barely recognizable. Hardly anyone connected Lord Voldemort with the clever, handsome boy who was once Head Boy here. “Sit down, Harry,” “It certainly seems so.” “Put you in Gryffindor,” His own very rare gift, Parseltongue — resourcefulness — determination — a certain disregard for rules,” “Yet the Sorting Hat placed you in Gryffindor. You know why that was. Think.” “If you want proof, Harry, that you belong in Gryffindor, I suggest you look more closely at this.” “Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat, Harry, “Good evening, Lucius,” Well, you see, Lucius, the other eleven governors contacted me today. It was something like being caught in a hailstorm of owls, to tell the truth. They’d heard that Arthur Weasley’s daughter had been killed and wanted me back here at once. They seemed to think I was the best man for the job after all. Very strange tales they told me, too. “We have,” “A clever plan,” “and his friend Ron hadn’t discovered this book, why — Ginny Weasley might have taken all the blame. No one would ever have been able to prove she hadn’t acted of her own free will. . . .” Merry Christmas! As there are so few of us, it seemed foolish to use the House tables. . . . Sit down, sit down! Crackers! Dig in! Sybill, this is a pleasant surprise! I’m afraid the poor fellow is ill again, Most unfortunate that it should happen on Christmas Day. I doubt, that Professor Lupin is in any immediate danger. Severus, you’ve made the potion for him again? Good, Then he should be up and about in no time. . . . Derek, have you had any of these chipolatas? They’re excellent. That, indeed, is Black’s story, I would like to speak to Harry and Hermione alone, Cornelius, Severus, Poppy — please leave us. I wish to speak to Harry and Hermione alone, My memory is as good as it ever was, Severus, It is your turn to listen, and I beg you will not interrupt me, because there is very little time, There is not a shred of proof to support Black’s story, except your word — and the word of two thirteen-year-old wizards will not convince anybody. A street full of eyewitnesses swore they saw Sirius murder Pettigrew. I myself gave evidence to the Ministry that Sirius had been the Potters’ Secret-Keeper. Professor Lupin is currently deep in the forest, unable to tell anyone anything. By the time he is human again, it will be too late, Sirius will be worse than dead. Listen to me, Harry. It is too late, you understand me? You must see that Professor Snape’s version of events is far more convincing than yours. Sirius has not acted like an innocent man. Yes, I do, But I have no power to make other men see the truth, or to overrule the Minister of Magic. . . . What we need, is more time. Now, pay attention, Sirius is locked in Professor Flitwick’s office on the seventh floor. Thirteenth window from the right of the West Tower. If all goes well, you will be able to save more than one innocent life tonight. But remember this, both of you: You must not be seen. Miss Granger, you know the law — you know what is at stake. . . . You — must — not — be — seen. I am going to lock you in. It is — five minutes to midnight. Miss Granger, three turns should do it. Good luck. I am going to lock you in, It is five minutes to midnight. Miss Granger, three turns should do it. Good luck. Well? That will do, Severus, Think about what you are saying. This door has been locked since I left the ward ten minutes ago. Madam Pomfrey, have these students left their beds? Well, there you have it, Severus, Unless you are suggesting that Harry and Hermione are able to be in two places at once, I’m afraid I don’t see any point in troubling them further. Oh, he’s not unbalanced, He’s just suffered a severe disappointment. And the dementors? They’ll be removed from the school, I trust? Hagrid would like that, Your carriage is at the gates, Remus, Good-bye, then, Remus, Why so miserable, Harry? You should be very proud of yourself after last night. Didn’t make any difference? It made all the difference in the world, Harry. You helped uncover the truth. You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate. Indeed? Er — stranger than usual, you mean? It does not, Hasn’t your experience with the Time-Turner taught you anything, Harry? The consequences of our actions are always so complicated, so diverse, that predicting the future is a very difficult business indeed. . . . Professor Trelawney, bless her, is living proof of that. . . . You did a very noble thing, in saving Pettigrew’s life. But if he helps Voldemort back to power — ! Pettigrew owes his life to you. You have sent Voldemort a deputy who is in your debt. When one wizard saves another wizard’s life, it creates a certain bond between them . . . and I’m much mistaken if Voldemort wants his servant in the debt of Harry Potter. This is magic at its deepest, its most impenetrable, Harry. But trust me . . . the time may come when you will be very glad you saved Pettigrew’s life. I knew your father very well, both at Hogwarts and later, Harry, He would have saved Pettigrew too, I am sure of it. You think the dead we have loved ever truly leave us? You think that we don’t recall them more clearly than ever in times of great trouble? Your father is alive in you, Harry, and shows himself most plainly when you have need of him. How else could you produce that particular Patronus? Prongs rode again last night. Last night Sirius told me all about how they became Animagi, An extraordinary achievement — not least, keeping it quiet from me. And then I remembered the most unusual form your Patronus took, when it charged Mr. Malfoy down at your Quidditch match against Ravenclaw. So you did see your father last night, Harry. . . . You found him inside yourself. I have only two words to say to you, Tuck in. Mr. Filch, the caretaker, has asked me to tell you that the list of objects forbidden inside the castle has this year been extended to include Screaming Yo-yos, Fanged Frisbees, and Ever-Bashing Boomerangs. The full list comprises some four hundred and thirty-seven items, I believe, and can be viewed in Mr. Filch’s office, if anybody would like to check it. As ever, I would like to remind you all that the forest on the grounds is out-of-bounds to students, as is the village of Hogsmeade to all below third year. It is also my painful duty to inform you that the Inter-House Quidditch Cup will not take place this year. This is due to an event that will be starting in October, and continuing throughout the school year, taking up much of the teachers’ time and energy — but I am sure you will all enjoy it immensely. I have great pleasure in announcing that this year at Hogwarts — May I introduce our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher? Professor Moody. As I was saying, we are to have the honor of hosting a very exciting event over the coming months, an event that has not been held for over a century. It is my very great pleasure to inform you that the Triwizard Tournament will be taking place at Hogwarts this year. I am not joking, Mr. Weasley, though now that you mention it, I did hear an excellent one over the summer about a troll, a hag, and a leprechaun who all go into a bar . . . Er — but maybe this is not the time . . . no . . . where was I? Ah yes, the Triwizard Tournament . . . well, some of you will not know what this tournament involves, so I hope those who do know will forgive me for giving a short explanation, and allow their attention to wander freely. The Triwizard Tournament was first established some seven hundred years ago as a friendly competition between the three largest European schools of wizardry: The schools took it in turns to host the tournament once every five years, and it was generally agreed to be a most excellent way of establishing ties between young witches and wizards of different nationalities — until, that is, the death toll mounted so high that the tournament was discontinued. There have been several attempts over the centuries to reinstate the tournament, none of which has been very successful. However, our own Departments of International Magical Cooperation and Magical Games and Sports have decided the time is ripe for another attempt. We have worked hard over the summer to ensure that this time, no champion will find himself or herself in mortal danger. The Heads of Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving with their shortlisted contenders in October, and the selection of the three champions will take place at Halloween. An impartial judge will decide which students are most worthy to compete for the Triwizard Cup, the glory of their school, and a thousand Galleons personal prize money. Eager though I know all of you will be to bring the Triwizard Cup to Hogwarts, the Heads of the participating schools, along with the Ministry of Magic, have agreed to impose an age restriction on contenders this year. Only students who are of age — that is to say, seventeen years or older — will be allowed to put forward their names for consideration. This is a measure we feel is necessary, given that the tournament tasks will still be difficult and dangerous, whatever precautions we take, and it is highly unlikely that students below sixth and seventh year will be able to cope with them. I will personally be ensuring that no underage student hoodwinks our impartial judge into making them Hogwarts champion. I therefore beg you not to waste your time submitting yourself if you are under seventeen. The delegations from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving in October and remaining with us for the greater part of this year. I know that you will all extend every courtesy to our foreign guests while they are with us, and will give your whole-hearted support to the Hogwarts champion when he or she is selected. And now, it is late, and I know how important it is to you all to be alert and rested as you enter your lessons tomorrow morning. Bedtime! Chop chop! Aha! Unless I am very much mistaken, the delegation from Beauxbatons approaches! My dear Madame Maxime, Welcome to Hogwarts. In excellent form, I thank you, He should be here any moment, Would you like to wait here and greet him or would you prefer to step inside and warm up a trifle? Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher will be delighted to take care of them, the moment he has returned from dealing with a slight situation that has arisen with some of his other — er — charges. I assure you that Hagrid will be well up to the job, It will be attended to, The moment has come, The Triwizard Tournament is about to start. I would like to say a few words of explanation before we bring in the casket — — just to clarify the procedure that we will be following this year. Mr. Bagman and Mr. Crouch have worked tirelessly over the last few months on the arrangements for the Triwizard Tournament, and they will be joining myself, Professor Karkaroff, and Madame Maxime on the panel that will judge the champions’ efforts. The casket, then, if you please, Mr. Filch. The instructions for the tasks the champions will face this year have already been examined by Mr. Crouch and Mr. Bagman, and they have made the necessary arrangements for each challenge. There will be three tasks, spaced throughout the school year, and they will test the champions in many different ways . . . their magical prowess — their daring — their powers of deduction — and, of course, their ability to cope with danger. As you know, three champions compete in the tournament, one from each of the participating schools. They will be marked on how well they perform each of the tournament tasks and the champion with the highest total after task three will win the Triwizard Cup. The champions will be chosen by an impartial selector: the Goblet of Fire. Anybody wishing to submit themselves as champion must write their name and school clearly upon a slip of parchment and drop it into the goblet, Aspiring champions have twenty-four hours in which to put their names forward. Tomorrow night, Halloween, the goblet will return the names of the three it has judged most worthy to represent their schools. The goblet will be placed in the entrance hall tonight, where it will be freely accessible to all those wishing to compete. To ensure that no underage student yields to temptation, I will be drawing an Age Line around the Goblet of Fire once it has been placed in the entrance hall. Nobody under the age of seventeen will be able to cross this line. Finally, I wish to impress upon any of you wishing to compete that this tournament is not to be entered into lightly. Once a champion has been selected by the Goblet of Fire, he or she is obliged to see the tournament through to the end. The placing of your name in the goblet constitutes a binding, magical contract. There can be no change of heart once you have become a champion. Please be very sure, therefore, that you are wholeheartedly prepared to play before you drop your name into the goblet. Now, I think it is time for bed. Good night to you all. Well, the goblet is almost ready to make its decision, I estimate that it requires one more minute. Now, when the champions’ names are called, I would ask them please to come up to the top of the Hall, walk along the staff table, and go through into the next chamber where they will be receiving their first instructions. The champion for Durmstrang, The champion for Beauxbatons, The Hogwarts champion, Excellent! Well, we now have our three champions. I am sure I can count upon all of you, including the remaining students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang, to give your champions every ounce of support you can muster. By cheering your champion on, you will contribute in a very real — Thank you, Severus, Did you put your name into the Goblet of Fire, Harry? Did you ask an older student to put it into the Goblet of Fire for you? It is possible, of course, Alastor! How this situation arose, we do not know, It seems to me, however, that we have no choice but to accept it. Both Cedric and Harry have been chosen to compete in the tournament. This, therefore, they will do. . . . My dear Madame Maxime, if you have an alternative, I would be delighted to hear it. Pork chops! Igor, all this secrecy . . . one would almost think you didn’t want visitors. Oh I would never dream of assuming I know all Hogwarts’ secrets, Igor, Only this morning, for instance, I took a wrong turning on the way to the bathroom and found myself in a beautifully proportioned room I have never seen before, containing a really rather magnificent collection of chamber pots. When I went back to investigate more closely, I discovered that the room had vanished. But I must keep an eye out for it. Possibly it is only accessible at five-thirty in the morning. Or it may only appear at the quarter moon — or when the seeker has an exceptionally full bladder. More tea, I think, Hermione, Harry, and Ron still seem to want to know you, judging by the way they were attempting to break down the door. I have gone temporarily deaf and haven’t any idea what you said, Harry, Living proof of what I’ve been telling you, Hagrid, Really, Hagrid, if you are holding out for universal popularity, I’m afraid you will be in this cabin for a very long time, Not a week has passed since I became headmaster of this school when I haven’t had at least one owl complaining about the way I run it. But what should I do? Barricade myself in my study and refuse to talk to anybody? An excellent point, No, he did not! He held his head high and went about his business as usual! Of course, I’m not entirely sure he can read, so that may not have been bravery. . . . Good afternoon, You will join me for breakfast at eight-thirty in the Great Hall. No excuses. Good afternoon to you all. A conference before we give the marks, I think. Lumos, Stunned, No, Stay here. Rennervate. Lie still for a moment, Hagrid, I need you to fetch Professor Karkaroff, His student has been attacked. When you’ve done that, kindly alert Professor Moody — Karkaroff, please, Hagrid! but it is essential that we find him. Igor, Hagrid, no! Kindly escort Harry back up to the castle, Hagrid, You will take Harry back to school, Hagrid, Take him right up to Gryffindor Tower. And Harry — I want you to stay there. Anything you might want to do — any owls you might want to send — they can wait until morning, do you understand me? I think, Harry, it is time to return to my office, Come in, then. I quite understand, This? It is called a Pensieve, I sometimes find, and I am sure you know the feeling, that I simply have too many thoughts and memories crammed into my mind. At these times, I use the Pensieve. One simply siphons the excess thoughts from one’s mind, pours them into the basin, and examines them at one’s leisure. It becomes easier to spot patterns and links, you understand, when they are in this form. Certainly, Let me show you. A connection I could have made without assistance, but never mind. I was using the Pensieve when Mr. Fudge arrived for our meeting and put it away rather hastily. Undoubtedly I did not fasten the cabinet door properly. Naturally, it would have attracted your attention. Curiosity is not a sin, But we should exercise caution with our curiosity . . . yes, indeed . . . But why, Bertha, why did you have to follow him in the first place? No, That was Bertha as I remember her at school. So, Harry, Before you got lost in my thoughts, you wanted to tell me something. Quite understandable. Continue. I do know, Please continue. I see, You are not Sirius’s only correspondent, I have also been in contact with him ever since he left Hogwarts last year. It was I who suggested the mountainside cave as the safest place for him to stay. I have a theory, no more than that. . . . It is my belief that your scar hurts both when Lord Voldemort is near you, and when he is feeling a particularly strong surge of hatred. Because you and he are connected by the curse that failed, That is no ordinary scar. It is possible, I would say — probable. Harry — did you see Voldemort? How indeed? How indeed . . . Voldemort? Once again, Harry, I can only give you my suspicions. The years of Voldemort’s ascent to power,were marked with disappearances.  And there was a third disappearance, one which the Ministry, I regret to say, do not consider of any importance, for it concerns a Muggle. You see, I read the Muggle newspapers, unlike most of my Ministry friends. These disappearances seem to me to be linked. The Ministry disagrees — as you may have heard, while waiting outside my office. Yes, Harry? You could, I attended it many times, but some trials come back to me more clearly than others . . . particularly now. . . . Has Neville never told you why he has been brought up by his grandmother? No, His father, Frank, was an Auror just like Professor Moody. He and his wife were tortured for information about Voldemort’s whereabouts after he lost his powers, as you heard. No, They are insane. They are both in St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. I believe Neville visits them, with his grandmother, during the holidays. They do not recognize him. The Longbottoms were very popular, The attacks on them came after Voldemort’s fall from power, just when everyone thought they were safe. Those attacks caused a wave of fury such as I have never known. The Ministry was under great pressure to catch those who had done it. Unfortunately, the Longbottoms’ evidence was — given their condition — none too reliable. As to that, I have no idea. . . . has never been accused of any Dark activity since, No more has Professor Snape, What made you think he’d really stopped supporting Voldemort, Professor? That, Harry, is a matter between Professor Snape and myself. So, Harry, Please do not speak about Neville’s parents to anybody else. He has the right to let people know, when he is ready. And — Good luck with the third task. Ladies and gentlemen, in five minutes’ time, I will be asking you to make your way down to the Quidditch field for the third and final task of the Triwizard Tournament. Will the champions please follow Mr. Bagman down to the stadium now. Harry, you can’t help him now.It’s over.  Let go. That’s right, Harry . . . just let go now. . . . No, I would prefer — Harry, stay here — Stupefy! No  He will stay, Minerva, because he needs to understand, Understanding is the first step to acceptance, and only with acceptance can there be recovery. He needs to know who has put him through the ordeal he has suffered tonight, and why. Moody, The moment he took you, I knew — and I followed. Severus, please fetch me the strongest Truth Potion you possess, and then go down to the kitchens and bring up the house-elf called Winky. Minerva, kindly go down to Hagrid’s house, where you will find a large black dog sitting in the pumpkin patch. Take the dog up to my office, tell him I will be with him shortly, then come back here. Harry? I want you to come up to my office first, Harry, Sirius is waiting for us there. They are with Professor Sprout, She was Head of Cedric’s House, and knew him best. I need to know what happened after you touched the Portkey in the maze, Harry, If I thought I could help you, by putting you into an enchanted sleep and allowing you to postpone the moment when you would have to think about what has happened tonight, I would do it. But I know better. Numbing the pain for a while will make it worse when you finally feel it. You have shown bravery beyond anything I could have expected of you. I ask you to demonstrate your courage one more time. I ask you to tell us what happened. Very well, Voldemort has overcome that particular barrier. Harry, continue, please. Priori Incantatem, Exactly, Harry’s wand and Voldemort’s wand share cores. Each of them contains a feather from the tail of the same phoenix. This phoenix, in fact, Yes, Mr. Ollivander wrote to tell me you had bought the second wand, the moment you left his shop four years ago. They will not work properly against each other, If, however, the owners of the wands force the wands to do battle . . . a very rare effect will take place. One of the wands will force the other to regurgitate spells it has performed — in reverse. The most recent first . . . and then those which preceded it. . . . Which means, that some form of Cedric must have reappeared. Harry? All that would have happened is a kind of reverse echo. A shadow of the living Cedric would have emerged from the wand . . . am I correct, Harry? An echo, which retained Cedric’s appearance and character. I am guessing other such forms appeared . . . less recent victims of Voldemort’s wand. . . . Your parents? Very well, In reverse order. More would have appeared, of course, had you maintained the connection. Very well, Harry, these echoes, these shadows . . . what did they do? I will say it again, You have shown bravery beyond anything I could have expected of you tonight, Harry. You have shown bravery equal to those who died fighting Voldemort at the height of his powers. You have shouldered a grown wizard’s burden and found yourself equal to it — and you have now given us all that we have a right to expect. You will come with me to the hospital wing. I do not want you returning to the dormitory tonight. A Sleeping Potion, and some peace . . . Sirius, would you like to stay with him? What has happened? Why are you disturbing these people? But he cannot now give testimony, Cornelius, He cannot give evidence about why he killed those people. Lord Voldemort was giving him instructions, Cornelius, Those people’s deaths were mere by-products of a plan to restore Voldemort to full strength again. The plan succeeded. Voldemort has been restored to his body. As Minerva and Severus have doubtless told you, Crouch has helped Voldemort to return. When Harry touched the Triwizard Cup tonight, he was transported straight to Voldemort, He witnessed Lord Voldemort’s rebirth. I will explain it all to you if you will step up to my office. I am afraid I cannot permit you to question Harry tonight. Certainly, I believe Harry, I heard Crouch’s confession, and I heard Harry’s account of what happened after he touched the Triwizard Cup; I assume that you are referring to the pains Harry has been experiencing in his scar? Listen to me, Cornelius, Harry is as sane as you or I. That scar upon his forehead has not addled his brains. I believe it hurts him when Lord Voldemort is close by, or feeling particularly murderous. Voldemort has returned, If you accept that fact straightaway, Fudge, and take the necessary measures, we may still be able to save the situation. The first and most essential step is to remove Azkaban from the control of the dementors — The rest of us sleep less soundly in our beds, Cornelius, knowing that you have put Lord Voldemort’s most dangerous supporters in the care of creatures who will join him the instant he asks them! They will not remain loyal to you, Fudge! Voldemort can offer them much more scope for their powers and their pleasures than you can! With the dementors behind him, and his old supporters returned to him, you will be hard-pressed to stop him regaining the sort of power he had thirteen years ago! The second step you must take — and at once, is to send envoys to the giants. Extend them the hand of friendship, now, before it is too late, You are blinded, by the love of the office you hold, Cornelius! You place too much importance, and you always have done,  on the so-called purity of blood! You fail to recognize that it matters not what someone is born, but what they grow to be! Your dementor has just destroyed the last remaining member of a pure-blood family as old as any — and see what that man chose to make of his life! I tell you now — take the steps I have suggested, and you will be remembered, in office or out, as one of the bravest and greatest Ministers of Magic we have ever known. If your determination to shut your eyes will carry you as far as this, Cornelius, we have reached a parting of the ways. You must act as you see fit. And I — I shall act as I see fit. The only one against whom I intend to work, is Lord Voldemort. If you are against him, then we remain, Cornelius, on the same side. And now, it is time for two of our number to recognize each other for what they are. Sirius . . . if you could resume your usual form. He is here at my invitation, as are you, Severus. I trust you both. It is time for you to lay aside your old differences and trust each other. in the short term I will settle, for a lack of open hostility. You will shake hands. You are on the same side now. Time is short, and unless the few of us who know the truth stand united, there is no hope for any of us. That will do to be going on with, Now I have work for each of you. Fudge’s attitude, though not unexpected, changes everything. Sirius, I need you to set off at once. Lie low at Lupin’s for a while; I will contact you there. I must go downstairs, I must see the Diggorys. Harry — take the rest of your potion. I will see all of you later. I must have missed it, However, due to a lucky mistake I arrived at the Ministry three hours early, so no harm done. Not to worry, not to worry, We do, in fact, have a witness to the presence of dementors in that alleyway, other than Dudley Dursley, I mean. I may be wrong, but I am sure that under the Wizengamot Charter of Rights, the accused has the right to present witnesses for his or her case? Isn’t that the policy of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Madam Bones? I brought her with me, She’s just outside the door. Should I — ? Oh, It means that I think they were ordered there, Not if the dementors are taking orders from someone other than the Ministry of Magic these days, I have already given you my views on this matter, Cornelius. Then, we must ask ourselves why somebody within the Ministry ordered a pair of dementors into that alleyway on the second of August. If it is true that the dementors are taking orders only from the Ministry of Magic, and it is also true that two dementors attacked Harry and his cousin a week ago, then it follows logically that somebody at the Ministry might have ordered the attacks, Of course, these particular dementors may have been outside Ministry control — Then, Of course it isn’t, I was merely expressing my confidence that this matter will not go uninvestigated. Of course it isn’t, but the presence of dementors in that alleyway is highly relevant. Clause seven of the Decree states that magic may be used before Muggles in exceptional circumstances, and as those exceptional circumstances include situations that threaten the life of the wizard or witch himself, or witches, wizards, or Muggles present at the time of the — Of course you are, Of course it isn’t, Then we are in agreement that Harry’s use of the Patronus Charm in these circumstances falls precisely into the category of exceptional circumstances it describes? You have heard from an eyewitness, If you still doubt her truthfulness, call her back, question her again. I am sure she would not object. But naturally, you would not care how many times you heard from a witness, if the alternative was a serious miscarriage of justice, The house-elf in question is currently in the employ of Hogwarts School, I can summon him here in an instant to give evidence if you wish. And you very kindly did not press charges on that occasion, accepting, I presume, that even the best wizards cannot always control their emotions, — but as the Ministry has no authority to punish Hogwarts students for misdemeanors at school, Harry’s behavior there is not relevant to this inquiry, The Ministry does not have the power to expel Hogwarts students, Cornelius, as I reminded you on the night of the second of August, Nor does it have the right to confiscate wands until charges have been successfully proven, again, as I reminded you on the night of the second of August. In your admirable haste to ensure that the law is upheld, you appear, inadvertently I am sure, to have overlooked a few laws yourself. Ah, And you certainly seem to be making many changes, Cornelius. Why, in the few short weeks since I was asked to leave the Wizengamot, it has already become the practice to hold a full criminal trial to deal with a simple matter of underage magic! As far as I am aware, however, there is no law yet in place that says this court’s job is to punish Harry for every bit of magic he has ever performed. He has been charged with a specific offense and he has presented his defense. All he and I can do now is to await your verdict. Excellent, Well, I must be getting along. Good day to you all. To our newcomers, welcome! To our old hands — welcome back! There is a time for speech making, but this is not it. Tuck in! Oh, it’s you, Professor McGonagall . . . and . . . ah. How did you see this? You misunderstand me, I mean . . . can you remember — er — where you were positioned as you watched this attack happen? Were you perhaps standing beside the victim, or else looking down on the scene from above? Is Arthur seriously injured? You were listening? The man has red hair and glasses, Everard, you will need to raise the alarm, make sure he is found by the right people — Everard and Dilys were two of Hogwarts’s most celebrated Heads, Their renown is such that both have portraits hanging in other important Wizarding institutions. As they are free to move between their own portraits they can tell us what may be happening elsewhere . . . Please sit down, all three of you, Everard and Dilys may not be back for several minutes. . . . Professor McGonagall, if you could draw up extra chairs . . . We will need, a warning. Nothing at all, Cornelius, Thank you, Fortescue, that will do, I think you’ll find you’re wrong there, Dolores, Cornelius, I do not deny — and nor, I am sure, does Harry — that he was in the Hog’s Head that day, nor that he was trying to recruit students to a Defense Against the Dark Arts group. I am merely pointing out that Dolores is quite wrong to suggest that such a group was, at that time, illegal. If you remember, the Ministry decree banning all student societies was not put into effect until two days after Harry’s Hogsmeade meeting, so he was not breaking any rules in the Hog’s Head at all. Well, they certainly would be, if they had continued after the decree came into effect. Do you have any evidence that these meetings continued? Oh, can she tell us about six months’ worth of meetings? I was under the impression that she was merely reporting a meeting tonight. I cannot allow you to manhandle my students, Dolores, Well, the game is up, Would you like a written confession from me, Cornelius — or will a statement before these witnesses suffice? Dumbledore’s Army. Not Potter’s Army. Dumbledore’s Army. Yes, it is, I did, Tonight was supposed to be the first meeting, Merely to see whether they would be interested in joining me. I see now that it was a mistake to invite Miss Edgecombe, of course. Yes, it is, Be quiet, Harry, or I am afraid you will have to leave my office, Instead you get to arrest me, It’s like losing a Knut and finding a Galleon, isn’t it? Yes, Well, I’m afraid I do. Ah, ‘Come quietly. ’ I am afraid I am not going to come quietly at all, Cornelius. I have absolutely no intention of being sent to Azkaban. I could break out, of course — but what a waste of time, and frankly, I can think of a whole host of things I would rather be doing. Don’t be silly, Dawlish, I’m sure you are an excellent Auror, I seem to remember that you achieved ‘Outstanding’ in all your N. E.W.T.s, but if you attempt to — er — ‘bring me in’ by force, I will have to hurt you. Merlin’s beard, no, Not unless you are foolish enough to force me to. Oh yes he will, Minerva! Hogwarts needs you! Are you all right? Unfortunately, I had to hex Kingsley too, or it would have looked very suspicious, He was remarkably quick on the uptake, modifying Miss Edgecombe’s memory like that while everyone was looking the other way — thank him for me, won’t you, Minerva? Now, they will all awake very soon and it will be best if they do not know that we had time to communicate — you must act as though no time has passed, as though they were merely knocked to the ground, they will not remember — No, I am not leaving to go into hiding. Fudge will soon wish he’d never dislodged me from Hogwarts, I promise you . . . Listen to me, Harry, you must study Occlumency as hard as you can, do you understand me? Do everything Professor Snape tells you and practice it particularly every night before sleeping so that you can close your mind to bad dreams — you will understand why soon enough, but you must promise me — Remember — close your mind — — you will understand, It was foolish to come here tonight, Tom, We both know that there are other ways of destroying a man, Tom, Merely taking your life would not satisfy me, I admit — You are quite wrong, Stay where you are, Harry! Harry? If you proceed downstairs into the Department of Mysteries, Cornelius, you will find several escaped Death Eaters contained in the Death Chamber, bound by an Anti-Disapparation Jinx and awaiting your decision as to what to do with them. Here, But a few minutes ago you saw proof, with your own eyes, that I have been telling you the truth for a year. We can discuss that after I have sent Harry back to Hogwarts, I shall explain everything, when Harry is back at school. Portus. You will give the order to remove Dolores Umbridge from Hogwarts, You will tell your Aurors to stop searching for my Care of Magical Creatures teacher so that he can return to work. I will give you . . . half an hour of my time tonight, in which I think we shall be more than able to cover the important points of what has happened here. After that, I shall need to return to my school. If you need more help from me you are, of course, more than welcome to contact me at Hogwarts. Letters addressed to the headmaster will find me. “Take this Portkey, Harry.” I shall see you in half an hour, One . . . two . . . three . . . Thank you, Well, Harry, you will be pleased to hear that none of your fellow students are going to suffer lasting damage from the night’s events. Madam Pomfrey is patching everybody up now, Nymphadora Tonks may need to spend a little time in St. Mungo’s, but it seems that she will make a full recovery. I know how you are feeling, Harry, That’s enough, Phineas, There is no shame in what you are feeling, Harry, On the contrary . . . the fact that you can feel pain like this is your greatest strength. What don’t I know? Harry, suffering like this proves you are still a man! This pain is part of being human — You do care, Oh yes, you do, You have now lost your mother, your father, and the closest thing to a parent you have ever known. Of course you care. No, No, By all means continue destroying my possessions, I daresay I have too many. Not until I have had my say, You will, Because you are not nearly as angry with me as you ought to be. If you are to attack me, as I know you are close to doing, I would like to have thoroughly earned it. It is my fault that Sirius died, Or I should say almost entirely my fault — I will not be so arrogant as to claim responsibility for the whole. Sirius was a brave, clever, and energetic man, and such men are not usually content to sit at home in hiding while they believe others to be in danger. Nevertheless, you should never have believed for an instant that there was any necessity for you to go to the Department of Mysteries tonight. If I had been open with you, Harry, as I should have been, you would have known a long time ago that Voldemort might try and lure you to the Department of Mysteries, and you would never have been tricked into going there tonight. And Sirius would not have had to come after you. That blame lies with me, and with me alone. Please sit down, Yes, Phineas, Harry, I owe you an explanation, An explanation of an old man’s mistakes. For I see now that what I have done, and not done, with regard to you, bears all the hallmarks of the failings of age.  Youth cannot know how age thinks and feels. But old men are guilty if they forget what it was to be young . . . and I seem to have forgotten lately . . . fifteen years ago, when I saw the scar upon your forehead, what it might mean. I guessed that it might be the sign of a connection forged between you and Voldemort. Yes, Yes, but you see — it is necessary to start with your scar. For it became apparent, shortly after you rejoined the magical world, that I was correct, and that your scar was giving you warnings when Voldemort was close to you, or else feeling powerful emotion. More recently, I became concerned that Voldemort might realize that this connection between you exists. Sure enough, there came a time when you entered so far into his mind and thoughts that he sensed your presence. I am speaking, of course, of the night when you witnessed the attack on Mr. Weasley. Professor Snape, Harry, But did you not wonder why it was not I who explained this to you? Why I did not teach you Occlumency? Why I had not so much as looked at you for months? You see, I believed it could not be long before Voldemort attempted to force his way into your mind, to manipulate and misdirect your thoughts, and I was not eager to give him more incentives to do so. I was sure that if he realized that our relationship was — or had ever been — closer than that of headmaster and pupil, he would seize his chance to use you as a means to spy on me. I feared the uses to which he would put you, the possibility that he might try and possess you. Harry, I believe I was right to think that Voldemort would have made use of you in such a way. On those rare occasions when we had close contact, I thought I saw a shadow of him stir behind your eyes. Voldemort’s aim in possessing you, as he demonstrated tonight, would not have been my destruction. It would have been yours. He hoped, when he possessed you briefly a short while ago, that I would sacrifice you in the hope of killing him. Sirius told me that you felt Voldemort awake inside you the very night that you had the vision of Arthur Weasley’s attack. I knew at once that my worst fears were correct: Voldemort from that point had realized he could use you. In an attempt to arm you against Voldemort’s assaults on your mind, I arranged Occlumency lessons with Professor Snape. Professor Snape discovered, that you had been dreaming about the door to the Department of Mysteries for months. And then you saw Rookwood, who worked in the Department of Mysteries before his arrest, telling Voldemort what we had known all along — that the prophecies held in the Ministry of Magic are heavily protected. Only the people to whom they refer can lift them from the shelves without suffering madness. In this case, either Voldemort himself would have to enter the Ministry of Magic and risk revealing himself at last — or else you would have to take it for him. It became a matter of even greater urgency that you should master Occlumency. Kreacher lied, You are not his master, he could lie to you without even needing to punish himself. Kreacher intended you to go to the Ministry of Magic. Kreacher seized his opportunity shortly before Christmas, when Sirius, apparently, shouted at him to ‘get out. ’ He took Sirius at his word and interpreted this as an order to leave the house. He went to the only Black family member for whom he had any respect left.. . . Black’s cousin Narcissa, sister of Bellatrix and wife of Lucius Malfoy. He went to the only Black family member for whom he had any respect left. Professor Snape discovered, You see, when you gave Professor Snape that cryptic warning, he realized that you had had a vision of Sirius trapped in the bowels of the Department of Mysteries. He, like you, attempted to contact Sirius at once. I should explain that members of the Order of the Phoenix have more reliable methods of communicating than the fire in Dolores Umbridge’s office. Professor Snape found that Sirius was alive and safe in Grimmauld Place. When, however, you did not return from your trip into the forest with Dolores Umbridge, Professor Snape grew worried that you still believed Sirius to be a captive of Lord Voldemort’s. He alerted certain Order members at once. Alastor Moody, Nymphadora Tonks, Kingsley Shacklebolt, and Remus Lupin were at headquarters when he made contact. All agreed to go to your aid at once. Professor Snape requested that Sirius remain behind, as he needed somebody to remain at headquarters to tell me what had happened, for I was due there at any moment. In the meantime he, Professor Snape, intended to search the forest for you. But Sirius did not wish to remain behind while the others went to search for you. He delegated to Kreacher the task of telling me what had happened. Yes, You see, Kreacher was not able to betray us totally. He is not Secret-Keeper for the Order, he could not give the Malfoys our whereabouts or tell them any of the Order’s confidential plans that he had been forbidden to reveal. He was bound by the enchantments of his kind, which is to say that he could not disobey a direct order from his master, Sirius. But he gave Narcissa information of the sort that is very valuable to Voldemort, yet must have seemed much too trivial for Sirius to think of banning him from repeating it. Like the fact that the person Sirius cared most about in the world was you, Like the fact that you were coming to regard Sirius as a mixture of father and brother. Voldemort knew already, of course, that Sirius was in the Order, that you knew where he was — but Kreacher’s information made him realize that the one person whom you would go to any lengths to rescue was Sirius Black. The Malfoys — undoubtedly on Voldemort’s instructions — had told him he must find a way of keeping Sirius out of the way once you had seen the vision of Sirius being tortured. Then, if you decided to check whether Sirius was at home or not, Kreacher would be able to pretend he was not. Kreacher injured Buckbeak the hippogriff yesterday, and at the moment when you made your appearance in the fire, Sirius was upstairs trying to tend to him. He did not wish to tell me, But I am a sufficiently accomplished Legilimens myself to know when I am being lied to and I — persuaded him — to tell me the full story, before I left for the Department of Mysteries. She was quite right, Harry, I warned Sirius when we adopted twelve Grimmauld Place as our headquarters that Kreacher must be treated with kindness and respect. I also told him that Kreacher could be dangerous to us. I do not think that Sirius took me very seriously, or that he ever saw Kreacher as a being with feelings as acute as a human’s — Kreacher is what he has been made by wizards, Harry, Yes, he is to be pitied. His existence has been as miserable as your friend Dobby’s. He was forced to do Sirius’s bidding, because Sirius was the last of the family to which he was enslaved, but he felt no true loyalty to him. And whatever Kreacher’s faults, it must be admitted that Sirius did nothing to make Kreacher’s lot easier — Harry, you know that Professor Snape had no choice but to pretend not to take you seriously in front of Dolores Umbridge, but as I have explained, he informed the Order as soon as possible about what you had said. It was he who deduced where you had gone when you did not return from the forest. It was he too who gave Professor Umbridge fake Veritaserum when she was attempting to force you to tell of Sirius’s whereabouts . . . Sirius was much too old and clever to have allowed such feeble taunts to hurt him, I know, I have already said that it was a mistake for me not to teach you myself, though I was sure, at the time, that nothing could have been more dangerous than to open your mind even further to Voldemort while in my presence — I trust Severus Snape, But I forgot — another old man’s mistake — that some wounds run too deep for the healing. I thought Professor Snape could overcome his feelings about your father — I was wrong. Sirius did not hate Kreacher, He regarded him as a servant unworthy of much interest or notice. Indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike. . . . The fountain we destroyed tonight told a lie. We wizards have mistreated and abused our fellows for too long, and we are now reaping our reward. I did not say that, nor will you ever hear me say it, Sirius was not a cruel man, he was kind to house-elves in general. He had no love for Kreacher, because Kreacher was a living reminder of the home Sirius had hated. I was trying to keep Sirius alive, It is time, for me to tell you what I should have told you five years ago, Harry. Please sit down. I am going to tell you everything. I ask only a little patience. You will have your chance to rage at me — to do whatever you like — when I have finished. I will not stop you. Five years ago you arrived at Hogwarts, Harry, safe and whole, as I had planned and intended. Well — not quite whole. You had suffered. I knew you would when I left you on your aunt and uncle’s doorstep. I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years. You might ask — and with good reason — why it had to be so. Why could some Wizarding family not have taken you in? Many would have done so more than gladly, would have been honored and delighted to raise you as a son. I don’t believe it, You were in more danger than perhaps anyone but myself realized. Voldemort had been vanquished hours before, but his supporters — and many of them are almost as terrible as he — were still at large, angry, desperate, and violent. And I had to make my decision too with regard to the years ahead. I knew that Voldemort’s knowledge of magic is perhaps more extensive than any wizard alive. I knew that even my most complex and powerful protective spells and charms were unlikely to be invincible if he ever returned to full power. But I knew too where Voldemort was weak. And so I made my decision. You would be protected by an ancient magic  of which he knows, which he despises, and which he has always, therefore, underestimated — to his cost. I am speaking, of course, of the fact that your mother died to save you. She gave you a lingering protection he never expected, a protection that flows in your veins to this day. I put my trust, therefore, in your mother’s blood. I delivered you to her sister, her only remaining relative. But she took you, She may have taken you grudgingly, furiously, unwillingly, bitterly, yet still she took you, and in doing so, she sealed the charm I placed upon you. Your mother’s sacrifice made the bond of blood the strongest shield I could give you. While you can still call home the place where your mother’s blood dwells, there you cannot be touched or harmed by Voldemort. He shed her blood, but it lives on in you and her sister. Her blood became your refuge. You need return there only once a year, but as long as you can still call it home, there he cannot hurt you. Your aunt knows this. I explained what I had done in the letter I left, with you, on her doorstep. She knows that allowing you houseroom may well have kept you alive for the past fifteen years. Yes, “And then … well, you will remember the events of your first year at Hogwarts quite as clearly as I do. You rose magnificently to the challenge that faced you, and sooner — much sooner — than I had anticipated, you found yourself face-to-face with Voldemort. You sur-vived again. You did more. You delayed his return to full power and strength. You fought a man’s fight. I was … prouder of you than I can say. “Ought I to have told you then?” “You do not see the flaw in the plan yet? No … perhaps not. Well, as you know, I decided not to answer you. Eleven, I told myself, was much too young to know. I had never intended to tell you when you were eleven. The knowledge would be too much at such a young age. “I should have recognized the danger signs then. I should have asked myself why I did not feel more disturbed that you had already asked me the question to which I knew, one day, I must give a terrible answer. I should have recognized that I was too happy to think that I did not have to do it on that particular day. … You were too young, much too young. “And so we entered your second year at Hogwarts. And once again you met challenges even grown wizards have never faced. Once again you acquitted yourself beyond my wildest dreams. You did not ask me again, however, why Voldemort had left that mark upon you. We dis-cussed your scar, oh yes. … We came very, very close to the subject. Why did I not tell you everything?  and if I felt a twinge of unease that I ought, perhaps, have told you then, it was swiftly si-lenced.  You were still so young, you see, and I could not find it in me to spoil that night of triumph. … Do you see, Harry?  Do you see the flaw in my brilliant plan now?  I had fallen into the trap I had foreseen, that I had told myself I could avoid, that I must avoid. I don’t — “Is there a defense? I defy anyone who has watched you as I have — and I have watched you more closely than you can have imagined — not to want to save you more pain than you had already suffered. What did I care if numbers of nameless and faceless people and crea-tures were slaughtered in the vague future, if in the here and now you were alive, and well, and happy? I never dreamed that I would have such a person on my hands. “We entered your third year.   My con-science was uneasy, Harry. I knew the time must come soon. … But you came out of the maze last year, having watched Cedric Diggory die, having escaped death so narrowly yourself … and I did not tell you, though I knew, now Voldemort had returned, I must do it soon. And now, tonight, I know you have long been ready for the knowledge I have kept from you for so long, because you have proved that I should have placed the burden upon you before this. My only defense is this: I have watched you struggling under more burdens than any student who has ever passed through this school, and I could not bring myself to add another — the greatest one of all.” “Voldemort tried to kill you when you were a child because of a prophecy made shortly before your birth. He knew the prophecy had been made, though he did not know its full contents. He set out to kill you when you were still a baby, believing he was fulfilling the terms of the prophecy. He discovered, to his cost, that he was mis-taken, when the curse intended to kill you backfired. And so, since his return to his body, and particularly since your extraordinary escape from him last year, he has been determined to hear that prophecy in its entirety. This is the weapon he has been seeking so assiduously since his return: the knowledge of how to destroy you.” “The thing that smashed was merely the record of the prophecy kept by the Department of Mysteries. But the prophecy was made to somebody, and that person has the means of recalling it perfectly.” “You are forgetting the next part of the prophecy, the final identi-fying feature of the boy who could vanquish Voldemort. … Volde-mort himself would ‘mark him as his equal.’ And so he did, Harry. He chose you, not Neville. He gave you the scar that has proved both blessing and curse.” “He heard only the first part, the part foretelling the birth of a boy in July to parents who had thrice defied Voldemort. Consequently, he could not warn his master that to attack you would be to risk transferring power to you — again marking you as his equal. So Voldemort never knew that there might be danger in attacking you, that it might be wise to wait or to learn more. He did not know that you would have ‘power the Dark Lord knows not’ —” “Yet there was a flaw in this wonderful plan of mine,” An obvious flaw that I knew, even then, might be the undo-ing of it all.  And yet, knowing how important it was that my plan should succeed, I told myself that I would not permit this flaw to ruin it.  I alone could prevent this, so I alone must be strong.  And here was my first test, as you lay in the hospital wing, weak from your struggle with Voldemort.” “Don’t you remember asking me, as you lay in the hospital wing, why Voldemort had tried to kill you when you were a baby?” ‘ . . . while the other survives,’ “Yes,”  I feel I owe you another explanation, Harry, You may, perhaps, have wondered why I never chose you as a prefect?  I must confess .that I rather thought . . . you had enough responsibility to be going on with. Good evening. You must be Mr. Dursley. I daresay Harry has told you I would be coming for him? Judging by your look of stunned disbelief, Harry did not warn you that I was coming, However, let us assume that you have invited me warmly into your house. It is unwise to linger overlong on doorsteps in these troubled times. It is a long time since my last visit, I must say, your agapanthus are flourishing. Ah, good evening Harry, Excellent, excellent. — yet, sadly, accidental rudeness occurs alarmingly often, Best to say nothing at all, my dear man. Ah, and this must be Petunia. Albus Dumbledore We have corresponded, of course. Harry thought this an odd way of reminding Aunt Petunia that he had once sent her an exploding letter, but Aunt Petunia did not challenge the term. And this must be your son, Dudley? Shall we assume that you have invited me into your sitting room? Yes, indeed we are, but there are a few matters we need to discuss first, And I would prefer not to do so in the open. We shall trespass upon your aunt and uncle’s hospitality only a little longer. Yes, I shall. We may as well be comfortable, Later, Harry, Please sit down. I would assume that you were going to offer me refreshment, but the evidence so far suggests that that would be optimistic to the point of foolishness. Madam Rosmerta’s finest oak-matured mead, Well, Harry, a difficulty has arisen which I hope you will be able to solve for us. By us, I mean the Order of the Phoenix. But first of all I must tell you that Sirius’s will was discovered a week ago and that he left you everything he owned. This is, in the main, fairly straightforward, You add a reasonable amount of gold to your account at Gringotts, and you inherit all of Sirius’s personal possessions. The slightly problematic part of the legacy — Yes, Our problem, is that Sirius also left you number twelve, Grimmauld Place. That is generous, We have, however, vacated the building temporarily. Well, Black family tradition decreed that the house was handed down the direct line, to the next male with the name of ‘Black. Quite, And if such an enchantment exists, then the ownership of the house is most likely to pass to the eldest of Sirius’s living relatives, which would mean his cousin, Bellatrix Lestrange. Quite, The situation is fraught with complications. We do not know whether the enchantments we ourselves have placed upon it, for example, making it Unplottable, will hold now that ownership has passed from Sirius’s hands. It might be that Bellatrix will arrive on the doorstep at any moment. Naturally we had to move out until such time as we have clarified the position. Fortunately, there is a simple test. Oh, I’m so sorry, But it would have been better manners to drink it, you know. You see, if you have indeed inherited the house, you have also inherited — Kreacher, As you can see, Harry, You would prefer him to pass into the ownership of Bellatrix Lestrange? Bearing in mind that he has lived at the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix for the past year? Give him an order, If he has passed into your ownership, he will have to obey. If not, then we shall have to think of some other means of keeping him from his rightful mistress. / It seems that Sirius knew what he was doing. You are the rightful owner of number twelve, Grimmauld Place and of Kreacher. Good, There is also the matter of the hippogriff, Buckbeak. Hagrid has been looking after him since Sirius died, but Buckbeak is yours now, so if you would prefer to make different arrangements — Yeah, Incidentally, we have decided, in the interests of Buckbeak’s safety, to rechristen him ‘Witherwings’ for the time being, though I doubt that the Ministry would ever guess he is the hippogriff they once sentenced to death. Now, Harry, is your trunk packed? Doubtful that I would turn up? Good, Just one last thing, then. As you will no doubt be aware, Harry comes of age in a year’s time — I’m sorry? but in the Wizarding world, we come of age at seventeen. Now, as you already know, the wizard called Lord Voldemort has returned to this country. The Wizarding community is currently in a state of open warfare. You did not do as I asked. You have never treated Harry as a son. He has known nothing but neglect and often cruelty at your hands. The best that can be said is that he has at least escaped the appalling damage you have inflicted upon the unfortunate boy sitting between you. The magic I evoked fifteen years ago means that Harry has powerful protection while he can still call this house ‘home. ’ However miserable he has been here, however unwelcome, however badly treated, you have at least, grudgingly, allowed him houseroom. This magic will cease to operate the moment that Harry turns seventeen; in other words, at the moment he becomes a man. I ask only this: that you allow Harry to return, once more, to this house, before his seventeenth birthday, which will ensure that the protection continues until that time.  Until we meet again, Bye, We do not want to be encumbered by these just now, I shall send them to the Burrow to await us there. Well, Harry, Are you all right? The sensation does take some getting used to. This way. So tell me, Harry, Your scar . . . has it been hurting at all? I, on the other hand, thought otherwise, Lord Voldemort has finally realized the dangerous access to his thoughts and feelings you have been enjoying. It appears that he is now employing Occlumency against you. Harry? This, Harry, is the charming village of Budleigh Babberton. Ah yes, of course, I haven’t told you, Well, I have lost count of the number of times I have said this in recent years, but we are, once again, one member of staff short. We are here to persuade an old colleague of mine to come out of retirement and return to Hogwarts. Oh, I think we’ll find a use for you, Left here, Harry. Because it would be quite as rude as kicking down the front door, Courtesy dictates that we offer fellow wizards the opportunity of denying us entry. In any case, most Wizarding dwellings are magically protected from unwanted Apparators. At Hogwarts, for instance — And she is quite right. We turn left again. Correct, He has been replaced, as I am sure you also saw, by Rufus Scrimgeour, who used to be Head of the Auror office. An interesting question, He is able, certainly. A more decisive and forceful personality than Cornelius. I know what you meant. Rufus is a man of action and, having fought Dark wizards for most of his working life, does not underestimate Lord Voldemort. You do, A terrible loss. She was a great witch. Just up here, I think — ouch. I have no time to explain now, It is a thrilling tale, I wish to do it justice. Yes Did you find it useful? No You have not asked me, for instance, what is my favorite flavor of jam, to check that I am indeed Professor Dumbledore and not an impostor. Still, They are corpses, Dead bodies that have been bewitched to do a Dark wizard’s bidding. Inferi have not been seen for a long time, however, not since Voldemort was last powerful. . . . He killed enough people to make an army of them, of course. This is the place, Harry, just here. . . . Oh, Wand out and follow me, Harry, Lumos. You do, Yes, something horrible has happened here. I don’t think so, Still here somewhere? Yes. Good evening, Horace, My dear Horace, if the Death Eaters really had come to call, the Dark Mark would have been set over the house. Would you like my assistance clearing up? What kind of blood was that, incidentally? This, is Harry Potter. Harry, this is an old friend and colleague of mine, Horace Slughorn. I suppose we can have a drink, at least? For old time’s sake? Well, how have you been keeping, Horace? And yet you must have moved fairly quickly to prepare such a welcome for us at such short notice, You can’t have had more than three minutes’ warning? Still, You’re not yet as old as I am, Horace, You’re quite right, I am undoubtedly slower than I was. But on the other hand . . . So, all these precautions against intruders, Horace . . . are they for the Death Eaters’ benefit, or mine? I imagine that they would want you to turn your considerable talents to coercion, torture, and murder, Are you really telling me that they haven’t come recruiting yet? Still, Professor Umbridge ran afoul of our centaur herd, I think you, Horace, would have known better than to stride into the forest and call a horde of angry centaurs ‘filthy half-breeds. ’ No, I was wondering whether I might use your bathroom, No, I do love knitting patterns. Well, Harry, we have trespassed upon Horace’s hospitality quite long enough; I think it is time for us to leave. Yes, indeed. I think I know a lost cause when I see one. Well, I’m sorry you don’t want the job, Horace, Hogwarts would have been glad to see you back again. Our greatly increased security notwithstanding, you will always be welcome to visit, should you wish to. Good-bye, then. You will come out of retirement? Wonderful, Then, Horace, we shall see you on the first of September. Well done Oh, You showed Horace exactly how much he stands to gain by returning to Hogwarts. Did you like him? Horace likes his comfort. He also likes the company of the famous, the successful, and the powerful. He enjoys the feeling that he influences these people. He has never wanted to occupy the throne himself; he prefers the backseat — more room to spread out, you see. He used to handpick favorites at Hogwarts, sometimes for their ambition or their brains, sometimes for their charm or their talent, and he had an uncanny knack for choosing those who would go on to become outstanding in their various fields. I tell you all this, not to turn you against Horace — or, as we must now call him, Professor Slughorn — but to put you on your guard. He will undoubtedly try to collect you, Harry. You would be the jewel of his collection; ‘the Boy Who Lived’ . . . or, as they call you these days, ‘the Chosen One. ’ This will do, Harry. If you will grasp my arm. If you don’t mind, Harry, I’d like a few words with you before we part. In private. Perhaps in here? Correct, Permit me to say that I think Sirius would have been proud of you. It was cruel, that you and Sirius had such a short time together. A brutal ending to what should have been a long and happy relationship. Sirius represented much to you that you had never known before, Naturally, the loss is devastating. . . . Spoken both like your mother and father’s son and Sirius’s true godson! I take my hat off to you — or I would, if I were not afraid of showering you in spiders. On a different, though related, subject, it is my wish that you take private lessons with me this year. Yes, Oh, Professor Snape, Harry — and no, you will not. I think the word ‘fiasco’ would be a good one here, Don’t count your owls before they are delivered, Which, now I think of it, ought to be some time later today. Now, two more things, Harry, before we part. Firstly, I wish you to keep your Invisibility Cloak with you at all times from this moment onward. Even within Hogwarts itself. Just in case, you understand me? And lastly, while you stay here, the Burrow has been given the highest security the Ministry of Magic can provide. These measures have caused a certain amount of inconvenience to Arthur and Molly — all their post, for instance, is being searched at the Ministry before being sent on. They do not mind in the slightest, for their only concern is your safety. However, it would be poor repayment if you risked your neck while staying with them. Very well, then, I see a light in the kitchen. Let us not deprive Molly any longer of the chance to deplore how thin you are. It is I, Dumbledore, bringing Harry. We were lucky, Slughorn proved much more persuadable than I had expected. Harry’s doing, of course. Ah, hello, Nymphadora! Please don’t leave on my account, I cannot stay, I have urgent matters to discuss with Rufus Scrimgeour. Well, I shall see you at Hogwarts, Harry, Take care of yourself. Molly, your servant. The very best of evenings to you! Nothing to worry about, Another year full of magical education awaits you . . . . . . and Mr. Filch, our caretaker, has asked me to say that there is a blanket ban on any joke items bought at the shop called Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes. Those wishing to play for their House Quidditch teams should give their names to their Heads of House as usual. We are also looking for new Quidditch commentators, who should do likewise. We are pleased to welcome a new member of staff this year. Professor Slughorn Professor Snape, meanwhile, will be taking over the position of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Now, as everybody in this Hall knows, Lord Voldemort and his followers are once more at large and gaining in strength. I cannot emphasize strongly enough how dangerous the present situation is, and how much care each of us at Hogwarts must take to ensure that we remain safe. The castle’s magical fortifications have been strengthened over the summer, we are protected in new and more powerful ways, but we must still guard scrupulously against carelessness on the part of any student or member of staff. I urge you, therefore, to abide by any security restrictions that your teachers might impose upon you, however irksome you might find them — in particular, the rule that you are not to be out of bed after hours. I implore you, should you notice anything strange or suspicious within or outside the castle, to report it to a member of staff immediately. I trust you to conduct yourselves, always, with the utmost regard for your own and others’ safety. / Let us therefore say good night. Pip pip! Come in, Ah, good evening, Harry. Sit down, I hope you’ve had an enjoyable first week back at school? You must have been busy, a detention under your belt already! I have arranged with Professor Snape that you will do your detention next Saturday instead. So, Harry, You have been wondering, I am sure, what I have planned for you during these — for want of a better word — lessons? Well, I have decided that it is time, now that you know what prompted Lord Voldemort to try and kill you fifteen years ago, for you to be given certain information. And so I did, I told you everything I know. From this point forth, we shall be leaving the firm foundation of fact and journeying together through the murky marshes of memory into thickets of wildest guesswork. From here on in, Harry, I may be as woefully wrong as Humphrey Belcher, who believed the time was ripe for a cheese cauldron. Naturally I do, but as I have already proven to you, I make mistakes like the next man. In fact, being — forgive me — rather cleverer than most men, my mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger. It has a very great deal to do with the prophecy, and I certainly hope that it will help you to survive. You look worried. This time, you enter the Pensieve with me . . . and, even more unusually, with permission. For a trip down Bob Ogden’s memory lane, He was employed by the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, We are about to accompany him on a visit he made in the course of his duties. If you will stand, Harry . . . No matter, Harry — Now is not the moment for that story, Harry. After you, You understand him, I’m sure, Harry? Very good, Oh, she survived, Ogden Apparated back to the Ministry and returned with reinforcements within fifteen minutes. Morfin and his father attempted to fight, but both were overpowered, removed from the cottage, and subsequently convicted by the Wizengamot. Morfin, who already had a record of Muggle attacks, was sentenced to three years in Azkaban. Marvolo, who had injured several Ministry employees in addition to Ogden, received six months. Yes, I am glad to see you’re keeping up. Voldemort’s grandfather, yes, Marvolo, his son, Morfin, and his daughter, Merope, were the last of the Gaunts, a very ancient Wizarding family noted for a vein of instability and violence that flourished through the generations due to their habit of marrying their own cousins. Lack of sense coupled with a great liking for grandeur meant that the family gold was squandered several generations before Marvolo was born. He, as you saw, was left in squalor and poverty, with a very nasty temper, a fantastic amount of arrogance and pride, and a couple of family heirlooms that he treasured just as much as his son, and rather more than his daughter. It does, And it so happens that we also had a glimpse of Voldemort’s father. I wonder whether you noticed? Very good indeed, Yes, that was Tom Riddle senior, the handsome Muggle who used to go riding past the Gaunt cottage and for whom Merope Gaunt cherished a secret, burning passion. I think you are forgetting, that Merope was a witch. I do not believe that her magical powers appeared to their best advantage when she was being terrorized by her father. Once Marvolo and Morfin were safely in Azkaban, once she was alone and free for the first time in her life, then, I am sure, she was able to give full rein to her abilities and to plot her escape from the desperate life she had led for eighteen years. Can you not think of any measure Merope could have taken to make Tom Riddle forget his Muggle companion, and fall in love with her instead? Very good, You can imagine the gossip it caused when the squire’s son ran off with the tramp’s daughter, Merope. But the villagers’ shock was nothing to Marvolo’s. He returned from Azkaban, expecting to find his daughter dutifully awaiting his return with a hot meal ready on his table. Instead, he found a clear inch of dust and her note of farewell, explaining what she had done. From all that I have been able to discover, he never mentioned her name or existence from that time forth. The shock of her desertion may have contributed to his early death — or perhaps he had simply never learned to feed himself. Azkaban had greatly weakened Marvolo, and he did not live to see Morfin return to the cottage. It does, We must do a certain amount of guessing here, although I do not think it is difficult to deduce what happened. The rumor flew around the neighborhood that he was talking of being ‘hoodwinked’ and ‘taken in. ’ What he meant, I am sure, is that he had been under an enchantment that had now lifted, though I daresay he did not dare use those precise words for fear of being thought insane. When they heard what he was saying, however, the villagers guessed that Merope had lied to Tom Riddle, pretending that she was going to have his baby, and that he had married her for this reason. But not until a year after they were married. Tom Riddle left her while she was still pregnant. Again, this is guesswork, but I believe that Merope, who was deeply in love with her husband, could not bear to continue enslaving him by magical means. I believe that she made the choice to stop giving him the potion. Perhaps, besotted as she was, she had convinced herself that he would by now have fallen in love with her in return. Perhaps she thought he would stay for the baby’s sake. If so, she was wrong on both counts. He left her, never saw her again, and never troubled to discover what became of his son. I think that will do for tonight, Harry, Very important, I think, It has a very great deal to do with the prophecy, Yes, I think Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger have proved themselves trustworthy. But Harry, I am going to ask you to ask them not to repeat any of this to anybody else. It would not be a good idea if word got around how much I know, or suspect, about Lord Voldemort’s secrets. Yes? So I was, “The very same.” No, I acquired it very recently, A few days before I came to fetch you from your aunt and uncle’s, in fact. It does, Good night. You shall hear the story another time. Good night. You have had a busy time while I have been away, I believe you witnessed Katie’s accident. Still very unwell, although she was relatively lucky. She appears to have brushed the necklace with the smallest possible amount of skin: There was a tiny hole in her glove. Had she put it on, had she even held it in her ungloved hand, she would have died, perhaps instantly. Luckily Professor Snape was able to do enough to prevent a rapid spread of the curse — Yes, thank you, Phineas, Professor Snape knows much more about the Dark Arts than Madam Pomfrey, Harry. Anyway, the St. Mungo’s staff are sending me hourly reports, and I am hopeful that Katie will make a full recovery in time. I would rather not say just now, However, I shall tell you in due course. Yes, I expect so, Ah yes, I am already aware that Mundungus has been treating your inheritance with light-fingered contempt, He has gone to ground since you accosted him outside the Three Broomsticks; I rather think he dreads facing me. However, rest assured that he will not be making away with any more of Sirius’s old possessions. She told me of your suspicions, yes, I shall take all appropriate measures to investigate anyone who might have had a hand in Katie’s accident, But what concerns me now, Harry, is our lesson. You will remember, I am sure, that we left the tale of Lord Voldemort’s beginnings at the point where the handsome Muggle, Tom Riddle, had abandoned his witch wife, Merope, and returned to his family home in Little Hangleton. Merope was left alone in London, expecting the baby who would one day become Lord Voldemort. Because of the evidence of one Caractacus Burke, who, by an odd coincidence, helped found the very shop whence came the necklace we have just been discussing. Yes, we acquired it in curious circumstances. It was brought in by a young witch just before Christmas, oh, many years ago now. She said she needed the gold badly, well, that much was obvious. Covered in rags and pretty far along .. . Going to have a baby, see. She said the locket had been Slytherin’s. Well, we hear that sort of story all the time, Of course, that made it near enough priceless. She didn’t seem to have any idea how much it was worth. Happy to get ten Galleons for it. Best bargain we ever made! Caractacus Burke was not famed for his generosity, So we know that, near the end of her pregnancy, Merope was alone in London and in desperate need of gold, desperate enough to sell her one and only valuable possession, the locket that was one of Marvolo’s treasured family heirlooms. Ah, perhaps she could. But it is my belief — I am guessing again, but I am sure I am right — that when her husband abandoned her, Merope stopped using magic. I do not think that she wanted to be a witch any longer. Of course, it is also possible that her unrequited love and the attendant despair sapped her of her powers; that can happen. In any case, as you are about to see, Merope refused to raise her wand even to save her own life. Could you possibly be feeling sorry for Lord Voldemort? Your mother had a choice too, Yes, Merope Riddle chose death in spite of a son who needed her, but do not judge her too harshly, Harry. She was greatly weakened by long suffering and she never had your mother’s courage. And now, if you will stand . . . This time, we are going to enter my memory. I think you will find it both rich in detail and satisfyingly accurate. After you, Harry . . . There I am, Good afternoon. I have an appointment with a Mrs. Cole, who, I believe, is the matron here? Good afternoon, My name is Albus Dumbledore. I sent you a letter requesting an appointment and you very kindly invited me here today. I think that will do, Sit down, Yes, No, No, I had no idea that he was to grow up to be what he is. However, I was certainly intrigued by him. I returned to Hogwarts intending to keep an eye upon him, something I should have done in any case, given that he was alone and friendless, but which, already, I felt I ought to do for others’ sake as much as his. His powers, as you heard, were surprisingly well-developed for such a young wizard and — most interestingly and ominously of all — he had already discovered that he had some measure of control over them, and begun to use them consciously. And as you saw, they were not the random experiments typical of young wizards: He was already using magic against other people, to frighten, to punish, to control. The little stories of the strangled rabbit and the young boy and girl he lured into a cave were most suggestive. . . . ‘I can make them hurt if I want to. . . .’ Yes, In fact, his ability to speak to serpents did not make me nearly as uneasy as his obvious instincts for cruelty, secrecy, and domination. Time is making fools of us again, But before we part, I want to draw your attention to certain features of the scene we have just witnessed, for they have a great bearing on the matters we shall be discussing in future meetings. Firstly, I hope you noticed Riddle’s reaction when I mentioned that another shared his first name, ‘Tom’? There he showed his contempt for anything that tied him to other people, anything that made him ordinary. Even then, he wished to be different, separate, notorious. He shed his name, as you know, within a few short years of that conversation and created the mask of ‘Lord Voldemort’ behind which he has been hidden for so long. I trust that you also noticed that Tom Riddle was already highly self-sufficient, secretive, and, apparently, friendless? He did not want help or companionship on his trip to Diagon Alley. He preferred to operate alone. The adult Voldemort is the same. You will hear many of his Death Eaters claiming that they are in his confidence, that they alone are close to him, even understand him. They are deluded. Lord Voldemort has never had a friend, nor do I believe that he has ever wanted one. And lastly — I hope you are not too sleepy to pay attention to this, Harry — the young Tom Riddle liked to collect trophies. You saw the box of stolen articles he had hidden in his room. These were taken from victims of his bullying behavior, souvenirs, if you will, of particularly unpleasant bits of magic. Bear in mind this magpie-like tendency, for this, particularly, will be important later. And now, it really is time for bed. Yes, Harry? Very astute, Harry, but the mouth organ was only ever a mouth organ. I hear that you met the Minister of Magic over Christmas? No, He is not very happy with me either. We must try not to sink beneath our anguish, Harry, but battle on. It was Fudge’s idea originally During his last days in office, when he was trying desperately to cling to his post, he sought a meeting with you, hoping that you would give him your support — I told Cornelius there was no chance of it, but the idea did not die when he left office. Within hours of Scrimgeour’s appointment we met and he demanded that I arrange a meeting with you — The Prophet is bound to report the truth occasionally, if only accidentally. Yes, that was why we argued. Well, it appears that Rufus found a way to corner you at last. How very rude of him. I am very touched, Harry. Not great, He has even attempted to have me followed. Amusing, really. He set Dawlish to tail me. It wasn’t kind. I have already been forced to jinx Dawlish once; I did it again with the greatest regret. I dunno, Now, I suggest we press on, unless there’s anything else — ? Professor Snape, Harry. Thank you for telling me this, Harry, but I suggest that you put it out of your mind. Yes, Harry, blessed as I am with extraordinary brainpower, I understood everything you told me, I think you might even consider the possibility that I understood more than you did. Again, I am glad that you have confided in me, but let me reassure you that you have not told me anything that causes me disquiet. I have been tolerant enough to answer that question already, My answer has not changed. And now, Harry, I must insist that we press on. I have more important things to discuss with you this evening. Ah, Harry, how often this happens, even between the best of friends! Each of us believes that what he has to say is much more important than anything the other might have to contribute! Yeah, I have two more memories to show you this evening, both obtained with enormous difficulty, and the second of them is, I think, the most important I have collected. Because Morfin could not remember anything from that point onward, When he awoke next morning, he was lying on the floor, quite alone. Marvolo’s ring had gone. Meanwhile, in the village of Little Hangleton, a maid was running along the High Street, screaming that there were three bodies lying in the drawing room of the big house: Tom Riddle Senior and his mother and father. The Muggle authorities were perplexed. As far as I am aware, they do not know to this day how the Riddles died, for the Avada Kedavra curse does not usually leave any sign of damage. . . . The exception sits before me, The Ministry, on the other hand, knew at once that this was a wizard’s murder. They also knew that a convicted Muggle-hater lived across the valley from the Riddle house, a Muggle-hater who had already been imprisoned once for attacking one of the murdered people. So the Ministry called upon Morfin. They did not need to question him, to use Veritaserum or Legilimency. He admitted to the murder on the spot, giving details only the murderer could know.He was proud, he said, to have killed the Muggles, had been awaiting his chance all these years. He handed over his wand, which was proved at once to have been used to kill the Riddles. And he permitted himself to be led off to Azkaban without a fight. All that disturbed him was the fact that his father’s ring had disappeared. ‘He’ll kill me for losing it,’  he told his captors over and over again. ‘He’ll kill me for losing his ring. ’ And that, apparently, was all he ever said again. He lived out the remainder of his life in Azkaban, lamenting the loss of Marvolo’s last heirloom, and is buried beside the prison, alongside the other poor souls who have expired within its walls. That’s right, We have no memories to show us this, but I think we can be fairly sure what happened. Voldemort Stupefied his uncle, took his wand, and proceeded across the valley to ‘the big house over the way. ’ There he murdered the Muggle man who had abandoned his witch mother, and, for good measure, his Muggle grandparents, thus obliterating the last of the unworthy Riddle line and revenging himself upon the father who never wanted him. Then he returned to the Gaunt hovel, performed the complex bit of magic that would implant a false memory in his uncle’s mind, laid Morfin’s wand beside its unconscious owner, pocketed the ancient ring he wore, and departed. No, I did not. Yes, but it took a great deal of skilled Legilimency to coax it out of him, and why should anybody delve further into Morfin’s mind when he had already confessed to the crime? However, I was able to secure a visit to Morfin in the last weeks of his life, by which time I was attempting to discover as much as I could about Voldemort’s past. I extracted this memory with difficulty. When I saw what it contained, I attempted to use it to secure Morfin’s release from Azkaban. Before the Ministry reached their decision, however, Morfin had died. You are quite right — they can detect magic, but not the perpetrator: You will remember that you were blamed by the Ministry for the Hover Charm that was, in fact, cast by — They will certainly be unable to tell who performed the magic, They rely on witch and wizard parents to enforce their offspring’s obedience while within their walls. I agree, Whatever Morfin was, he did not deserve to die as he did, blamed for murders he had not committed. But it is getting late, and I want you to see this other memory before we part. . . . This will not take long, We shall be back before you know it. Once more into the Pensieve, then . . . As you might have noticed, that memory has been tampered with. Certainly, Professor Slughorn has meddled with his own recollections. Because, I think, he is ashamed of what he remembers. He has tried to rework the memory to show himself in a better light, obliterating those parts which he does not wish me to see. It is, as you will have noticed, very crudely done, and that is all to the good, for it shows that the true memory is still there beneath the alterations. So, It will be your job to persuade Professor Slughorn to divulge the real memory, which will undoubtedly be our most crucial piece of information of all. Professor Slughorn is an extremely able wizard who will be expecting both. He is much more accomplished at Occlumency than poor Morfin Gaunt, and I would be astonished if he has not carried an antidote to Veritaserum with him ever since I coerced him into giving me this travesty of a recollection. So, I do not wish him to leave Hogwarts. However, he has his weaknesses like the rest of us, and I believe that you are the one person who might be able to penetrate his defenses. It is most important that we secure the true memory, Harry. . . . How important, we will only know when we have seen the real thing. So, good luck . . . and good night. I wouldn’t expect you to, Phineas, Enter, My dear Sybill, there is no question of throwing you unceremoniously from anywhere, but Harry does have an appointment, and I really don’t think there is any more to be said — Please close the door and sit down, Harry, No, Divination is turning out to be much more trouble than I could have foreseen, never having studied the subject myself. She does not know — and I think it would be unwise to enlighten her — that she made the prophecy about you and Voldemort, you see. But never mind my staffing problems. We have much more important matters to discuss. Firstly — have you managed the task I set you at the end of our previous lesson? I see, And you feel that you have exerted your very best efforts in this matter, do you? That you have exercised all of your considerable ingenuity? That you have left no depth of cunning unplumbed in your quest to retrieve the memory? And did that work? — which, naturally, made you forget all about trying to retrieve the memory; I would have expected nothing else, while your best friend was in danger. Once it became clear that Mr. Weasley was going to make a full recovery, however, I would have hoped that you returned to the task I set you. I thought I made it clear to you how very important that memory is. Indeed, I did my best to impress upon you that it is the most crucial memory of all and that we will be wasting our time without it. Other things on your mind, I see. Thank you for saying that, Harry, May I hope, then, that you will give this matter higher priority from now on? There will be little point in our meeting after tonight unless we have that memory. Then we shall say no more about it just now, but continue with our story where we left off. You remember where that was? Very well, Now, you will remember, I hope, that I told you at the very outset of these meetings of ours that we would be entering the realms of guesswork and speculation? Thus far, as I hope you agree, I have shown you reasonably firm sources of fact for my deductions as to what Voldemort did until the age of seventeen? Now, This first one came from a very old house-elf by the name of Hokey. Before we see what Hokey witnessed, I must quickly recount how Lord Voldemort left Hogwarts. He reached the seventh year of his schooling with, as you might have expected, top grades in every examination he had taken. All around him, his classmates were deciding which jobs they were to pursue once they had left Hogwarts. Nearly everybody expected spectacular things from Tom Riddle, prefect, Head Boy, winner of the Award for Special Services to the School. I know that several teachers, Professor Slughorn amongst them, suggested that he join the Ministry of Magic, offered to set up appointments, put him in touch with useful contacts.He refused all offers. The next thing the staff knew, Voldemort was working at Borgin and Burkes. At Borgin and Burkes, I think you will see what attractions the place held for him when we have entered Hokey’s memory. But this was not Voldemort’s first choice of job. I believe he had several reasons, though he confided none of them to Professor Dippet, Firstly, and very importantly, Voldemort was, I believe, more attached to this school than he has ever been to a person. Hogwarts was where he had been happiest;the first and only place he had felt at home. Secondly, the castle is a stronghold of ancient magic. Undoubtedly Voldemort had penetrated many more of its secrets than most of the students who pass through the place, but he may have felt that there were still mysteries to unravel, stores of magic to tap. And thirdly, as a teacher, he would have had great power and influence over young witches and wizards. I do not imagine for an instant that Voldemort envisaged spending the rest of his life at Hogwarts, but I do think that he saw it as a useful recruiting ground, and a place where he might begin to build himself an army. No, he did not. Professor Dippet told him that he was too young at eighteen, but invited him to reapply in a few years, if he still wished to teach. Deeply uneasy, I had advised Armando against the appointment — I did not give the reasons I have given you, for Professor Dippet was very fond of Voldemort and convinced of his honesty. But I did not want Lord Voldemort back at this school, and especially not in a position of power. Defense Against the Dark Arts. It was being taught at the time by an old professor by the name of Galatea Merrythought, who had been at Hogwarts for nearly fifty years. So Voldemort went off to Borgin and Burkes, and all the staff who had admired him said what a waste it was, a brilliant young wizard like that, working in a shop. However, Voldemort was no mere assistant. Voldemort was sent to persuade people to part with their treasures for sale by the partners, and he was, by all accounts, unusually gifted at doing this. Ah, And now it is time to hear from Hokey the house-elf, who worked for a very old, very rich witch by the name of Hepzibah Smith. After you, Harry. Hepzibah Smith died two days after that little scene, Hokey the house-elf was convicted by the Ministry of poisoning her mistress’s evening cocoa by accident. I see we are of one mind, Certainly, there are many similarities between this death and that of the Riddles. In both cases, somebody else took the blame, someone who had a clear memory of having caused the death — She remembered putting something in her mistress’s cocoa that turned out not to be sugar, but a lethal and little-known poison. It was concluded that she had not meant to do it, but being old and confused — Yes, that is my conclusion too. And, just as with Morfin, the Ministry was predisposed to suspect Hokey — Precisely. She was old, she admitted to having tampered with the drink, and nobody at the Ministry bothered to inquire further. As in the case of Morfin, by the time I traced her and managed to extract this memory, her life was almost over — but her memory, of course, proves nothing except that Voldemort knew of the existence of the cup and the locket. By the time Hokey was convicted, Hepzibah’s family had realized that two of her greatest treasures were missing. It took them a while to be sure of this, for she had many hiding places, having always guarded her collection most jealously. But before they were sure beyond doubt that the cup and the locket were both gone, the assistant who had worked at Borgin and Burkes, the young man who had visited Hepzibah so regularly and charmed her so well, had resigned his post and vanished. His superiors had no idea where he had gone; they were as surprised as anyone at his disappearance. And that was the last that was seen or heard of Tom Riddle for a very long time. Now, if you don’t mind, Harry, I want to pause once more to draw your attention to certain points of our story. Voldemort had committed another murder; whether it was his first since he killed the Riddles, I do not know, but I think it was. This time, as you will have seen, he killed not for revenge, but for gain. He wanted the two fabulous trophies that poor, besotted, old woman showed him. Just as he had once robbed the other children at his orphanage, just as he had stolen his Uncle Morfin’s ring, so he ran off now with Hepzibah’s cup and locket. Mad to you, perhaps, but not to Voldemort, It had belonged to another of Hogwarts’s founders, said Dumbledore. I think he still felt a great pull toward the school and that he could not resist an object so steeped in Hogwarts history. There were other reasons, I think. . . . I hope to be able to demonstrate them to you in due course. Mine, I have ideas, but no more than that. I shall tell you, Harry, when you have retrieved that memory from Professor Slughorn, When you have that last piece of the jigsaw, everything will, I hope, be clear . . . to both of us. Oh Enter, Good gracious, Harry, To what do I owe this very late pleasure? Harry, this is spectacular news! Very well done indeed! I knew you could do it! And now, Now, at last, we shall see. Harry, quickly . . . Thank you, Harry, Let us go. . . . I have been hoping for this piece of evidence for a very long time, It confirms the theory on which I have been working, it tells me that I am right, and also how very far there is still to go. . . . Harry I am sure you understood the significance of what we just heard. At the same age as you are now, give or take a few months, Tom Riddle was doing all he could to find out how to make himself immortal. A bit . . . or more, You heard Voldemort: What he particularly wanted from Horace was an opinion on what would happen to the wizard who created more than one Horcrux, what would happen to the wizard so determined to evade death that he would be prepared to murder many times, rip his soul repeatedly, so as to store it in many, separately concealed Horcruxes. No book would have given him that information. As far as I know — as far, I am sure, as Voldemort knew — no wizard had ever done more than tear his soul in two. Four years ago, I received what I considered certain proof that Voldemort had split his soul. You handed it to me, Harry, The diary, Riddle’s diary, the one giving instructions on how to reopen the Chamber of Secrets. Well, Well, it worked as a Horcrux is supposed to work — in other words, the fragment of soul concealed inside it was kept safe and had undoubtedly played its part in preventing the death of its owner. But there could be no doubt that Riddle really wanted that diary read, wanted the piece of his soul to inhabit or possess somebody else, so that Slytherin’s monster would be unleashed again. Harry, But don’t you see, Harry, that if he intended the diary to be passed to, or planted on, some future Hogwarts student, he was being remarkably blasé about that precious fragment of his soul concealed within it. The point of a Horcrux is, as Professor Slughorn explained, to keep part of the self hidden and safe, not to fling it into somebody else’s path and run the risk that they might destroy it — as indeed happened: That particular fragment of soul is no more; you saw to that. The careless way in which Voldemort regarded this Horcrux seemed most ominous to me. It suggested that he must have made — or been planning to make — more Horcruxes, so that the loss of his first would not be so detrimental. I did not wish to believe it, but nothing else seemed to make sense. Then you told me, two years later, that on the night that Voldemort returned to his body, he made a most illuminating and alarming statement to his Death Eaters. ‘I, who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality. ’ That was what you told me he said. ‘Further than anybody. ’ And I thought I knew what that meant, though the Death Eaters did not. Yet it fitted: Lord Voldemort has seemed to grow less human with the passing years, and the transformation he has undergone seemed to me to be only explicable if his soul was mutilated beyond the realms of what we might call ‘usual evil’ . . . Well, we know that he tried to do just that, five years ago. But there are several reasons why, I think, a Sorcerer’s Stone would appeal less than Horcruxes to Lord Voldemort. Of course, Voldemort likes to operate alone, remember. I believe that he would have found the thought of being dependent, even on the Elixir, intolerable. Of course he was prepared to drink it if it would take him out of the horrible part-life to which he was condemned after attacking you, but only to regain a body. Thereafter, I am convinced, he intended to continue to rely on his Horcruxes: He would need nothing more, if only he could regain a human form. He was already immortal, you see . . . or as close to immortal as any man can be. And now, You heard him, Harry: ‘Wouldn’t it be better, make you stronger, to have your soul in more pieces . . . isn’t seven the most powerfully magical number . . . ’ Isn’t seven the most powerfully magical number. Yes, I think the idea of a seven-part soul would greatly appeal to Lord Voldemort. Harry, But firstly, no, Harry, not seven Horcruxes:six The seventh part of his soul, however maimed, resides inside his regenerated body. That was the part of him that lived a spectral existence for so many years during his exile; without that, he has no self at all. That seventh piece of soul will be the last that anybody wishing to kill Voldemort must attack — the piece that lives in his body. You are forgetting . . . you have already destroyed one of them. And I have destroyed another. Harry, The ring, Harry. Marvolo’s ring. And a terrible curse there was upon it too. Had it not been — forgive me the lack of seemly modesty — for my own prodigious skill, and for Professor Snape’s timely action when I returned to Hogwarts, desperately injured, I might not have lived to tell the tale. However, a withered hand does not seem an unreasonable exchange for a seventh of Voldemort’s soul. The ring is no longer a Horcrux. Well, as you now know, for many years I have made it my business to discover as much as I can about Voldemort’s past life.I have traveled widely, visiting those places he once knew. I stumbled across the ring hidden in the ruin of the Gaunts’ house. It seems that once Voldemort had succeeded in sealing a piece of his soul inside it, he did not want to wear it anymore. However, we should not congratulate ourselves too heartily. You destroyed the diary and I the ring, but if we are right in our theory of a seven-part soul, four Horcruxes remain. Well, Harry, But would Lord Voldemort use tin cans or old potion bottles to guard his own precious soul? You are forgetting what I have showed you. Lord Voldemort liked to collect trophies, and he preferred objects with a powerful magical history. His pride, his belief in his own superiority, his determination to carve for himself a startling place in magical history; these things suggest to me that Voldemort would have chosen his Horcruxes with some care, favoring objects worthy of the honor. The diary, as you have said yourself, was proof that he was the Heir of Slytherin; I am sure that Voldemort considered it of stupendous importance. I can only guess, For the reasons I have already given, I believe that Lord Voldemort would prefer objects that, in themselves, have a certain grandeur. I have therefore trawled back through Voldemort’s past to see if I can find evidence that such artifacts have disappeared around him. Yes, I would be prepared to bet — perhaps not my other hand — but a couple of fingers, that they became Horcruxes three and four. The remaining two, assuming again that he created a total of six, are more of a problem, but I will hazard a guess that, having secured objects from Hufflepuff and Slytherin, he set out to track down objects owned by Gryffindor or Ravenclaw. Four objects from the four founders would, I am sure, have exerted a powerful pull over Voldemort’s imagination. I cannot answer for whether he ever managed to find anything of Ravenclaw’s. I am confident, however, that the only known relic of Gryffindor remains safe. My thoughts precisely, said Dumbledore. But unfortunately, that does not advance us much further, for he was turned away, or so I believe, without the chance to search the school. I am forced to conclude that he never fulfilled his ambition of collecting four founders’ objects. He definitely had two — he may have found three — that is the best we can do for now. I don’t think so, I think I know what the sixth Horcrux is. I wonder what you will say when I confess that I have been curious for a while about the behavior of the snake, Nagini? Well, it is inadvisable to do so, said Dumbledore, because to confide a part of your soul to something that can think and move for itself is obviously a very risky business. However, if my calculations are correct, Voldemort was still at least one Horcrux short of his goal of six when he entered your parents’ house with the intention of killing you. He seems to have reserved the process of making Horcruxes for particularly significant deaths. He believed that in killing you, he was destroying the danger the prophecy had outlined. He believed he was making himself invincible. I am sure that he was intending to make his final Horcrux with your death. As we know, he failed. After an interval of some years, however, he used Nagini to kill an old Muggle man, and it might then have occurred to him to turn her into his last Horcrux. She underlines the Slytherin connection, which enhances Lord Voldemort’s mystique; I think he is perhaps as fond of her as he can be of anything; he certainly likes to keep her close, and he seems to have an unusual amount of control over her, even for a Parselmouth. An admirably succinct and accurate summary, yes, Yes, Yes, I think so. Well, I think you have earned that right. A very interesting question, Harry. I believe not. I believe that Voldemort is now so immersed in evil, and these crucial parts of himself have been detached for so long, he does not feel as we do. Perhaps, at the point of death, he might be aware of his loss . . . but he was not aware, for instance, that the diary had been destroyed until he forced the truth out of Lucius Malfoy. When Voldemort discovered that the diary had been mutilated and robbed of all its powers, I am told that his anger was terrible to behold. Of course, Yes indeed, Without his Horcruxes, Voldemort will be a mortal man with a maimed and diminished soul. Never forget, though, that while his soul may be damaged beyond repair, his brain and his magical powers remain intact. It will take uncommon skill and power to kill a wizard like Voldemort even without his Horcruxes. Yes, you have, You have a power that Voldemort has never had. You can — Well, Harry, Which, given everything that has happened to you, is a great and remarkable thing. You are still too young to understand how unusual you are, Harry. Well, Harry, But Harry, never forget that what the prophecy says is only significant because Voldemort made it so. I told you this at the end of last year. Voldemort singled you out as the person who would be most dangerous to him — and in doing so, he made you the person who would be most dangerous to him! No, it doesn’t! You are setting too much store by the prophecy! If Voldemort had never heard of the prophecy, would it have been fulfilled? Would it have meant anything? Of course not! Do you think every prophecy in the Hall of Prophecy has been fulfilled? Harry, If Voldemort had never murdered your father, would he have imparted in you a furious desire for revenge? Of course not! If he had not forced your mother to die for you, would he have given you a magical protection he could not penetrate? Don’t you see? Voldemort himself created his worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere do! Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realize that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back! Voldemort is no different! Always he was on the lookout for the one who would challenge him. He heard the prophecy and he leapt into action, with the result that he not only handpicked the man most likely to finish him, he handed him uniquely deadly weapons! Harry, By attempting to kill you, Voldemort himself singled out the remarkable person who sits here in front of me, and gave him the tools for the job! Harry, The only protection that can possibly work against the lure of power like Voldemort’s! Harry, have you any idea how few wizards could have seen what you saw in that mirror? Voldemort should have known then what he was dealing with, but he did not! But he knows it now. You have flitted into Lord Voldemort’s mind without damage to yourself, but he cannot possess you without enduring mortal agony, as he discovered in the Ministry. Got to? Of course you’ve got to! But not because of the prophecy! Because you, yourself, will never rest until you’ve tried! We both know it! Imagine, please, just for a moment, that you had never heard that prophecy! How would you feel about Voldemort now? Think! Of course you would! You see, the prophecy does not mean you have to do anything! But the prophecy caused Lord Voldemort to mark you as his equal. . . . In other words, you are free to choose your way, quite free to turn your back on the prophecy! But Voldemort continues to set store by the prophecy. He will continue to hunt you . . . which makes it certain, really, that — Yes. “Enter” Well, Harry, I promised that you could come with me. Only if you wish it, of course. I believe so. It is natural to be afraid, I am not sure which it is — though I think we can rule out the snake — but I believe it to be hidden in a cave on the coast many miles from here, a cave I have been trying to locate for a very long time: the cave in which Tom Riddle once terrorized two children from his orphanage on their annual trip; you remember? I do not know; I have suspicions that may be entirely wrong. Harry, I promised you that you could come with me, and I stand by that promise, but it would be very wrong of me not to warn you that this will be exceedingly dangerous. What has happened to you? What has upset you? Harry, you were never a good Occlumens — When did you find out about this? Harry, Please listen to me. Professor Snape made a terrible — Please let me finish. Professor Snape made a terrible mistake. He was still in Lord Voldemort’s employ on the night he heard the first half of Professor Trelawney’s prophecy. Naturally, he hastened to tell his master what he had heard, for it concerned his master most deeply. But he did not know — he had no possible way of knowing — which boy Voldemort would hunt from then onward, or that the parents he would destroy in his murderous quest were people that Professor Snape knew, that they were your mother and father — Harry, I believe it to be the greatest regret of his life and the reason that he returned — Harry, I have told you my views. What? Enough, Do you think that I have once left the school unprotected during my absences this year? I have not. Tonight, when I leave, there will again be additional protection in place. Please do not suggest that I do not take the safety of my students seriously, Harry. I do not wish to discuss the matter any further. Do you wish to come with me tonight? “Very well, then: Listen.” I take you with me on one condition: that you obey any command I might give you at once, and without question. ’ I mean that you must follow even such orders as ‘run,’ ‘hide,’ or ‘go back. ’ Do I have your word? If I tell you to hide, you will do so? If I tell you to flee, you will obey? If I tell you to leave me and save yourself, you will do as I tell you? Harry? I would like you to wear your Cloak, please, That I am off into Hogsmeade for a drink, I sometimes offer Rosmerta my custom, or else visit the Hog’s Head . . . or I appear to. It is as good a way as any of disguising one’s true destination. Yes, You can Apparate now, I believe? No matter, I can assist you again. What do you think? Not here, precisely, There is a village of sorts about halfway along the cliffs behind us. I believe the orphans were taken there for a little sea air and a view of the waves. No, I think it was only ever Tom Riddle and his youthful victims who visited this spot. I imagine that Riddle climbed down; magic would have served better than ropes. And he brought two small children with him, probably for the pleasure of terrorizing them. I think the journey alone would have done it, don’t you? But his final destination — and ours — lies a little farther on. Come. Lumos, You see? You will not object to getting a little wet? Then take off your Invisibility Cloak — there is no need for it now — and let us take the plunge. Yes, this is the place, It has known magic, This is merely the antechamber, the entrance hall, We need to penetrate the inner place. . . . Now it is Lord Voldemort’s obstacles that stand in our way, rather than those nature made. . . . Here, We go on through here. The entrance is concealed. Harry, I’m so sorry, I forgot, Oh, surely not. So crude. I rather think, that we are required to make payment to pass. Yes, Blood, if I am not much mistaken. So crude. The idea, as I am sure you will have gathered, is that your enemy must weaken him- or herself to enter. Once again, Lord Voldemort fails to grasp that there are much more terrible things than physical injury. Sometimes, however, it is unavoidable, You are very kind, Harry, But your blood is worth more than mine. Ah, that seems to have done the trick, doesn’t it? After me, I think, Let us walk, Be very careful not to step into the water. Stay close to me. Yes, Yes, I’m sure it is. The question is, how do we get to it? Certainly we could, Why don’t you do it? Something, I think, that is ready to respond should we attempt to seize the Horcrux. I thought something would happen if we made an obvious attempt to get our hands on the Horcrux. That was a very good idea, Harry; much the simplest way of finding out what we are facing. What the things are, you mean, I doubt very much that there is only one of them. Shall we walk on? Yes, Harry? Into it? Only if we are very unfortunate. Oh no . . . I think the Horcrux is in the middle. Yes, Aha, So sorry, Harry, I should have given warning. Stand back against the wall, please; I think I have found the place. Oho, Magic always leaves traces, sometimes very distinctive traces. I taught Tom Riddle. I know his style. Oh yes, I think so. Voldemort needed to create a means to cross the lake without attracting the wrath of those creatures he had placed within it in case he ever wanted to visit or remove his Horcrux. I think we must resign ourselves to the fact that they will, at some point, realize we are not Lord Voldemort. Thus far, however, we have done well. They have allowed us to raise the boat. I rather think, I think he would have been prepared to risk what was, to his mind, the most unlikely possibility that somebody else would find it, knowing that he had set other obstacles ahead that only he would be able to penetrate. We shall see whether he is right. Voldemort will not have cared about the weight, but about the amount of magical power that crossed his lake. I rather think an enchantment will have been placed upon this boat so that only one wizard at a time will be able to sail in it. I rather think, Voldemort would never have expected a sixteen-year-old to reach this place: I think it unlikely that your powers will register compared to mine. Voldemort’s mistake, Harry, Voldemort’s mistake . . . Age is foolish and forgetful when it underestimates youth. . . . Now, you first this time, and be careful not to touch the water. Yes, Harry? Yes, Yes, but we do not need to worry about them at the moment. Not while they are merely drifting peacefully below us, There is nothing to be feared from a body, Harry, any more than there is anything to be feared from the darkness. Lord Voldemort, who of course secretly fears both, disagrees. But once again he reveals his own lack of wisdom. It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more. Yes, I am sure that once we take the Horcrux, we shall find them less peaceable. However, like many creatures that dwell in cold and darkness, they fear light and warmth, which we shall therefore call to our aid should the need arise. Fire, Harry, Nearly there, Careful not to touch the water, I am not sure, Something more worrisome than blood and bodies, however. You see? See? I cannot approach any nearer than this. You try. Out of the way, please, Harry, Oh yes. But how to reach it? This potion cannot be penetrated by hand, Vanished, parted, scooped up, or siphoned away, nor can it be Transfigured, Charmed, or otherwise made to change its nature. Yes, I think so: Only by drinking it can I empty the basin and see what lies in its depths. Oh, I doubt that it would work like that, Lord Voldemort would not want to kill the person who reached this island. I’m sorry, Harry; He would want to keep them alive long enough to find out how they managed to penetrate so far through his defenses and, most importantly of all, why they were so intent upon emptying the basin. Do not forget that Lord Voldemort believes that he alone knows about his Horcruxes. Undoubtedly, this potion must act in a way that will prevent me taking the Horcrux. It might paralyze me, cause me to forget what I am here for, create so much pain I am distracted, or render me incapable in some other way. This being the case, Harry, it will be your job to make sure I keep drinking, even if you have to tip the potion into my protesting mouth. You understand? You remember, said Dumbledore, the condition on which I brought you with me? You swore, did you not, to follow any command I gave you? I warned you, did I not, that there might be danger? Well, then, you have my orders. Because I am much older, much cleverer, and much less valuable, Once and for all, Harry, do I have your word that you will do all in your power to make me keep drinking? Do I have it? Your word, Harry. Your good health, Harry. I don’t want . . . Don’t make me . . . . . . don’t like . . . want to stop . . . No . . . I don’t want to. . . . I don’t want to. . . . Let me go. . . . Make it stop, make it stop, No . . . It’s all my fault, all my fault, Please make it stop, I know I did wrong, oh please make it stop and I’ll never, never again . . . Don’t hurt them, don’t hurt them, please, please, it’s my fault, hurt me instead . . . Please, please, please, no . . . not that, not that, I’ll do anything . . . No more, please, no more . . .” I want to die! I want to die! Make it stop, make it stop, I want to die! KILL ME! Water Quite understandable, I am weak. . . . The protection was . . . after all . . . well-designed, One alone could not have done it. . . . You did well, very well, Harry. . . . The archway will have sealed again. . . . My knife . . . Here . . . I am not worried, Harry, I am with you. I’ve been better, That potion . . . was no health drink. . . . No, It is . . . Professor Snape whom I need. . . . But I do not think . . . I can walk very far just yet. . . . Severus . . . What has happened? Rosmerta, what’s wrong? When did it appear? No, Rosmerta, please send a message to the Ministry, It might be that nobody within Hogwarts has yet realized anything is wrong. . . . Harry, put on your Invisibility Cloak. Go and wake Severus, Tell him what has happened and bring him to me. Do nothing else, speak to nobody else, and do not remove your Cloak. I shall wait here. You swore to obey me, Harry — go! I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks. You cannot help. Harry. You wonderful boy. You brave, brave man. Let us walk. Oh yes, Ah, That is the question, isn’t it? On the whole, dear boy, I think not. On the whole, dear boy, I think not. And that, will, I think, have made all the difference. But you already know, You did, Go on! Harry. Yes, he destroyed it. Your soul is whole, and completely your own, Harry. Something that is beyond either of our help, I think you know, Think back. Remember what he did, in his ignorance, in his greed and his cruelty. Precisely! He took your blood and rebuilt his living body with it! Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lily’s protection inside both of you! He tethered you to life while he lives! There is no help possible. You were the seventh Horcrux, Harry, the Horcrux he never meant to make. He had rendered his soul so unstable that it broke apart when he committed those acts of unspeakable evil, the murder of your parents, the attempted killing of a child. But what escaped from that room was even less than he knew. He left more than his body behind. He left part of himself latched to you, the would-be victim who had survived. And his knowledge remained woefully incomplete, Harry! That which Voldemort does not value, he takes no trouble to comprehend. Of house-elves and children’s tales, of love, loyalty, and innocence, Voldemort knows and understands nothing. He took your blood believing it would strengthen him. He took into his body a tiny part of the enchantment your mother laid upon you when she died for you. His body keeps her sacrifice alive, and while that enchantment survives, so do you and so does Voldemort’s one last hope for himself. As to that, I cannot be sure. What you must understand, Harry, is that you and Lord Voldemort have journeyed together into realms of magic hitherto unknown and untested. But here is what I think happened, and it is unprecedented, and no wandmaker could, I think, ever have predicted it or explained it to Voldemort. as you now know, Lord Voldemort doubled the bond between you when he returned to a human form. A part of his soul was still attached to yours, and, thinking to strengthen himself, he took a part of your mother’s sacrifice into himself. If he could only have understood the precise and terrible power of that sacrifice, he would not, perhaps, have dared to touch your blood. . . . But then, if he had been able to understand, he could not be Lord Voldemort, and might never have murdered at all. Having ensured this two-fold connection, having wrapped your destinies together more securely than ever two wizards were joined in history, Voldemort proceeded to attack you with a wand that shared a core with yours. And now something very strange happened, as we know. The cores reacted in a way that Lord Voldemort, who never knew that your wand was twin of his, had never expected. Harry. You had accepted, even embraced, the possibility of death, something Lord Voldemort has never been able to do. Your courage won, your wand overpowered his. And in doing so, something happened between those wands, something that echoed the relationship between their masters. I believe that your wand imbibed some of the power and qualities of Voldemort’s wand that night, which is to say that it contained a little of Voldemort himself. So your wand recognized him when he pursued you, recognized a man who was both kin and mortal enemy, and it regurgitated some of his own magic against him, magic much more powerful than anything Lucius’s wand had ever performed. Your wand now contained the power of your enormous courage and of Voldemort’s own deadly skill: What chance did that poor stick of Lucius Malfoy’s stand? My dear boy, its remarkable effects were directed only at Voldemort, who had tampered so ill-advisedly with the deepest laws of magic. Only toward him was that wand abnormally powerful. Otherwise it was a wand like any other . . . though a good one, I am sure, He failed to kill you with my wand, I think we can agree that you are not dead — though, of course, I do not minimize your sufferings, which I am sure were severe. Well, I was going to ask you that, Where would you say that we are? King’s Cross station! Good gracious, really? My dear boy, I have no idea. This is, as they say, your party. Ah, yes, Harry. Can you forgive me for not trusting you? For not telling you? Harry, I only feared that you would fail as I had failed. I only dreaded that you would make my mistakes. I crave your pardon, Harry. I have known, for some time now, that you are the better man. The Hallows, the Hallows, A desperate man’s dream! Real, and dangerous, and a lure for fools, And I was such a fool. But you know, don’t you? I have no secrets from you anymore. You know. Master of death, Harry, master of Death! Was I better, ultimately, than Voldemort? Harry. Yet I too sought a way to conquer death, Harry. Hallows, not Horcruxes. Hallows, not Horcruxes. Precisely. It was the thing, above all, that drew us together, Two clever, arrogant boys with a shared obsession. He wanted to come to Godric’s Hollow, as I am sure you have guessed, because of the grave of Ignotus Peverell. He wanted to explore the place the third brother had died. — were the three brothers of the tale, Oh yes, I think so. Whether they met Death on a lonely road . . . I think it more likely that the Peverell brothers were simply gifted, dangerous wizards who succeeded in creating those powerful objects. The story of them being Death’s own Hallows seems to me the sort of legend that might have sprung up around such creations. The Cloak, as you know now, traveled down through the ages, father to son, mother to daughter, right down to Ignotus’s last living descendant, who was born, as Ignotus was, in the village of Godric’s Hollow. Hallows, It explained much of his undetected wrongdoing at school! I could hardly believe what I was seeing. I asked to borrow it, to examine it. I had long since given up my dream of uniting the Hallows, but I could not resist, could not help taking a closer look. . . . It was a Cloak the likes of which I had never seen, immensely old, perfect in every respect . . . and then your father died, and I had two Hallows at last, all to myself! True, True. Oh yes, You know what happened. Then you should, You know the secret of my sister’s ill health, what those Muggles did, what she became. You know how my poor father sought revenge, and paid the price, died in Azkaban. You know how my mother gave up her own life to care for Ariana. Harry. I was gifted, I was brilliant. I wanted to escape. I wanted to shine. I wanted glory. Do not misunderstand me, I loved them. I loved my parents, I loved my brother and my sister, but I was selfish, Harry, more selfish than you, who are a remarkably selfless person, could possibly imagine. So that, when my mother died, and I was left the responsibility of a damaged sister and a wayward brother, I returned to my village in anger and bitterness. Trapped and wasted, I thought! And then, of course, he came. . . . Grindelwald. You cannot imagine how his ideas caught me, Harry, inflamed me. Muggles forced into subservience. We wizards triumphant. Grindelwald and I, the glorious young leaders of the revolution. Oh, I had a few scruples. I assuaged my conscience with empty words. It would all be for the greater good, and any harm done would be repaid a hundredfold in benefits for wizards. Did I know, in my heart of hearts, what Gellert Grindelwald was? I think I did, but I closed my eyes. If the plans we were making came to fruition, all my dreams would come true. And at the heart of our schemes, the Deathly Hallows! How they fascinated him, how they fascinated both of us! The unbeatable wand, the weapon that would lead us to power! The Resurrection Stone — to him, though I pretended not to know it, it meant an army of Inferi! To me, I confess, it meant the return of my parents, and the lifting of all responsibility from my shoulders. Harry. I thought that, if we ever found it, it might be useful in hiding Ariana, but our interest in the Cloak was mainly that it completed the trio, for the legend said that the man who united all three objects would then be truly master of death, which we took to mean ‘invincible. ’ Invincible masters of death, Grindelwald and Dumbledore! Two months of insanity, of cruel dreams, and neglect of the only two members of my family left to me. You know what happened. Reality returned in the form of my rough, unlettered, and infinitely more admirable brother. I did not want to hear the truths he shouted at me. I did not want to hear that I could not set forth to seek Hallows with a fragile and unstable sister in tow. The argument became a fight. Grindelwald lost control. That which I had always sensed in him, though I pretended not to, now sprang into terrible being.  And Ariana .. . after all my mother’s care and caution . . . lay dead upon the floor. Well, Grindelwald fled, as anyone but I could have predicted. He vanished, with his plans for seizing power, and his schemes for Muggle torture, and his dreams of the Deathly Hallows, dreams in which I had encouraged him and helped him. He ran, while I was left to bury my sister, and learn to live with my guilt and my terrible grief, the price of my shame. Years passed. There were rumors about him. They said he had procured a wand of immense power. I, meanwhile, was offered the post of Minister of Magic, not once, but several times. Naturally, I refused. I had learned that I was not to be trusted with power. Would I? I am not so sure. I had proven, as a very young man, that power was my weakness and my temptation. It is a curious thing, Harry, but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it. Those who, like you, have leadership thrust upon them, and take up the mantle because they must, and find to their own surprise that they wear it well. I was safer at Hogwarts. I think I was a good teacher — Harry. But while I busied myself with the training of young wizards, Grindelwald was raising an army. They say he feared me, and perhaps he did, but less, I think, than I feared him. Oh, not death, Not what he could do to me magically. I knew that we were evenly matched, perhaps that I was a shade more skillful. It was the truth I feared. You see, I never knew which of us, in that last, horrific fight, had actually cast the curse that killed my sister. You may call me cowardly: You would be right. Harry, I dreaded beyond all things the knowledge that it had been I who brought about her death, not merely through my arrogance and stupidity, but that I actually struck the blow that snuffed out her life. I think he knew it, I think he knew what frightened me. I delayed meeting him until finally, it would have been too shameful to resist any longer. People were dying and he seemed unstoppable, and I had to do what I could. Well, you know what happened next. I won the duel. I won the wand. They say he showed remorse in later years, alone in his cell at Nurmengard. I hope that it is true. I would like to think he did feel the horror and shame of what he had done. Perhaps that lie to Voldemort was his attempt to make amends . . . to prevent Voldemort from taking the Hallow . . . Harry. I quite forgot that it was now a Horcrux, that the ring was sure to carry a curse. I picked it up, and I put it on, and for a second I imagined that I was about to see Ariana, and my mother, and my father, and to tell them how very, very sorry I was. . . . Harry. After all those years I had learned nothing. I was unworthy to unite the Deathly Hallows, I had proved it time and again, and here was final proof. Harry. I was fit only to possess the meanest of them, the least extraordinary. I was fit to own the Elder Wand, and not to boast of it, and not to kill with it. I was permitted to tame and to use it, because I took it, not for gain, but to save others from it. But the Cloak, I took out of vain curiosity, and so it could never have worked for me as it works for you, its true owner. The stone I would have used in an attempt to drag back those who are at peace, rather than to enable my self-sacrifice, as you did. You are the worthy possessor of the Hallows. Harry. I was afraid that your hot head might dominate your good heart. you might seize the Hallows as I did, at the wrong time, for the wrong reasons. If you laid hands on them, I wanted you to possess them safely. You are the true master of death, because the true master does not seek to run away from Death. He accepts that he must die, and understands that there are far, far worse things in the living world than dying. You did, But even if he had known about them, Harry, I doubt that he would have been interested in any except the first. He would not think that he needed the Cloak, and as for the stone, whom would he want to bring back from the dead? He fears the dead. He does not love. I have been sure that he would try, ever since your wand beat Voldemort’s in the graveyard of Little Hangleton. At first, he was afraid that you had conquered him by superior skill. Once he had kidnapped Ollivander, however, he discovered the existence of the twin cores. He thought that explained everything. Yet the borrowed wand did no better against yours! So Voldemort, instead of asking himself what quality it was in you that had made your wand so strong, what gift you possessed that he did not, naturally set out to find the one wand that, they said, would beat any other. For him, the Elder Wand has become an obsession to rival his obsession with you. He believes that the Elder Wand removes his last weakness and makes him truly invincible. Poor Severus . . . I admit that was my intention, but it did not work as I intended, did it? That is up to you. Didn’t I? You did, We are in King’s Cross, you say? I think that if you decided not to go back, you would be able to . . . let’s say . . . board a train. On, My dear boy, I do, A wise and courageous decision, but no less than I would have expected of you. Does anyone else know where it fell? Harry,",

Our new — celebrity. You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion-making, As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. Tut, tut — fame clearly isn’t everything. “Let’s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?” Thought you wouldn’t open a book before coming, eh, Potter?” “What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?” And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter. “Idiot boy!” “I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?” POTTER! GET OUT! OUT! Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid, Five points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn’t more. Move along, all of you. Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid’s yet? You don’t want me as your enemy, Quirrell, You know perfectly well what I mean. — your little bit of hocus-pocus. I’m waiting. Very well, We’ll have another little chat soon, when you’ve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie. “Good afternoon,” “You shouldn’t be inside on a day like this,” Hanging around like this, people will think you’re up to something. And Gryffindor really can’t afford to lose any more points, can it?” “Be warned, Potter — any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you.” If I might speak,  Potter and his friends may have simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time, But we do have a set of suspicious circumstances here. Why was he in the upstairs corridor at all? Why wasn’t he at the Halloween feast? Why go up to that corridor? I suggest, Headmaster, that Potter is not being entirely truthful, It might be a good idea if he were deprived of certain privileges until he is ready to tell us the whole story. I personally feel he should be taken off the Gryffindor Quidditch team until he is ready to be honest. “Expelliarmus!” Settle down, settle down, Weasley, cut up Malfoy’s roots for him, Change roots with Malfoy, Weasley. Now, Potter, you can skin Malfoy’s shrivelfig, Orange, Longbottom, Didn’t you hear me say, quite clearly, that only one rat spleen was needed? Didn’t I state plainly that a dash of leech juice would suffice? What do I have to do to make you understand, Longbottom? I don’t remember asking you to show off, Miss Granger, Longbottom, at the end of this lesson we will feed a few drops of this potion to your toad and see what happens. Perhaps that will encourage you to do it properly. You should have finished adding your ingredients by now; Everyone gather ’round, and watch what happens to Longbottom’s toad. If he has managed to produce a Shrinking Solution, it will shrink to a tadpole. If, as I don’t doubt, he has done it wrong, his toad is likely to be poisoned. Five points from Gryffindor, I told you not to help him, Miss Granger. Class dismissed. Leave it open, Lupin. I’d rather not witness this. Possibly no one’s warned you, Lupin, but this class contains Neville Longbottom. I would advise you not to entrust him with anything difficult. Not unless Miss Granger is hissing instructions in his ear. Fascinating, You should drink that directly, Lupin. I made an entire cauldronful, If you need more. Not at all, This lesson began ten minutes ago, Potter, so I think we’ll make it ten points from Gryffindor. Sit down. He says he is feeling too ill to teach today, I believe I told you to sit down? Nothing life-threatening, Five more points from Gryffindor, and if I have to ask you to sit down again, it will be fifty. As I was saying before Potter interrupted, Professor Lupin has not left any record of the topics you have covered so far — Be quiet, I did not ask for information. I was merely commenting on Professor Lupin’s lack of organization. You are easily satisfied. Today we shall discuss — — werewolves, Miss Granger, I was under the impression that I am teaching this lesson, not you. And I am telling you all to turn to page 394. All of you! Now! Which of you can tell me how we distinguish between the werewolf and the true wolf?  Are you telling me that Professor Lupin hasn’t even taught you the basic distinction between — — werewolves, Well, well, well, I never thought I’d meet a third-year class who wouldn’t even recognize a werewolf when they saw one. I shall make a point of informing Professor Dumbledore how very behind you all are. . . . That is the second time you have spoken out of turn, Miss Granger, Five more points from Gryffindor for being an insufferable know-it-all. Detention, Weasley, And if I ever hear you criticize the way I teach a class again, you will be very sorry indeed. Very poorly explained . . . That is incorrect, the kappa is more commonly found in Mongolia. . . . Professor Lupin gave this eight out of ten? I wouldn’t have given it three. . . . You will each write an essay, to be handed in to me, on the ways you recognize and kill werewolves. I want two rolls of parchment on the subject, and I want them by Monday morning. It is time somebody took this class in hand. Weasley, stay behind, we need to arrange your detention. Yes, Headmaster, “Sit, “Mr. Malfoy has just been to see me with a strange story, Potter,”  He tells me that he was up by the Shrieking Shack when he ran into Weasley — apparently alone.” Mr. Malfoy then saw an extraordinary apparition. Can you imagine what it might have been, Potter? It was your head, Potter. Floating in midair. What would your head have been doing in Hogsmeade, Potter? Your head is not allowed in Hogsmeade. No part of your body has permission to be in Hogsmeade. Malfoy is not having hallucinations, If your head was in Hogsmeade, so was the rest of you. Can anyone confirm that? So, Everyone from the Minister of Magic downward has been trying to keep famous Harry Potter safe from Sirius Black. But famous Harry Potter is a law unto himself. Let the ordinary people worry about his safety! Famous Harry Potter goes where he wants to, with no thought for the consequences. Your father didn’t set much store by rules either “What did you say to me, Potter?” “Have you been imagining some act of glorious heroism? Then let me correct you — your saintly father and his friends played a highly amusing joke on me that would have resulted in my death if your father hadn’t got cold feet at the last moment. There was nothing brave about what he did. He was saving his own skin as much as mine. Had their joke succeeded, he would have been expelled from Hogwarts.” “Turn out your pockets, Potter!” “Turn out your pockets, or we go straight to the headmaster! Pull them out, Potter!” Indeed? “Show yourself!” “Professor Severus Snape, master of this school, commands you to yield the information you conceal!” Well? Don’t ask me to fathom the way a werewolf’s mind works, Get out of the way, Potter. Thank you, Minister. Thank you very much indeed, Minister. As a matter of fact, it was Potter, Weasley, and Granger, Minister. . . . No! Black had bewitched them, I saw it immediately. A Confundus Charm, to judge by their behavior. They seemed to think there was a possibility he was innocent. They weren’t responsible for their actions. On the other hand, their interference might have permitted Black to escape. . . . They obviously thought they were going to catch Black single-handed. They’ve got away with a great deal before now.. . . I’m afraid it’s given them a rather high opinion of themselves . . . and of course Potter has always been allowed an extraordinary amount of license by the headmaster — And yet — is it good for him to be given so much special treatment? Personally, I try and treat him like any other student. And any other student would be suspended — at the very least — for leading his friends into such danger. No, Minister . . . by the time I had come ’round they were heading back to their positions at the entrances. . . . Extraordinary. And yet Black, and Harry, and the girl — All unconscious by the time I reached them. I bound and gagged Black, naturally, conjured stretchers, and brought them all straight back to the castle. You see, Minister? Confunded, both of them. . . . Black’s done a very good job on them. . . . I suppose he’s told you the same fairy tale he’s planted in Potter’s mind? Something about a rat, and Pettigrew being alive — And does my evidence count for nothing? Peter Pettigrew was not in the Shrieking Shack, nor did I see any sign of him on the grounds. Miss Granger, HOLD YOUR TONGUE! You surely don’t believe a word of Black’s story? Sirius Black showed he was capable of murder at the age of sixteen, You haven’t forgotten that, Headmaster? You haven’t forgotten that he once tried to kill me? HE DIDN’T DISAPPARATE! YOU CAN’T APPARATE OR DISAPPARATE INSIDE THIS CASTLE! THIS — HAS — SOMETHING — TO — DO — WITH — POTTER! WHAT DID YOU DO? THEY HELPED HIM ESCAPE, I KNOW IT! YOU DON’T KNOW POTTER! HE DID IT, I KNOW HE DID IT — It’s no one’s fault but Potter’s, Karkaroff, Don’t go blaming Dumbledore for Potter’s determination to break rules. He has been crossing lines ever since he arrived here — And what is all this noise about? Explain. Hospital wing, Goyle, I see no difference. Let’s see, Fifty points from Gryffindor and a detention each for Potter and Weasley. Now get inside, or it’ll be a week’s worth of detentions. . . . don’t see what there is to fuss about, Igor. Then flee, Flee — I will make your excuses. I, however, am remaining at Hogwarts. What? And ten points from Hufflepuff too, Stebbins! And what are you two doing? Keep walking, then! Filch? What’s going on? Peeves? But Peeves couldn’t get into my office. . . . — I was coming to investigate — — and when I passed my office, I saw that the torches were lit and a cupboard door was ajar! Somebody has been searching it! I know he couldn’t, Filch! I seal my office with a spell none but a wizard could break! I want you to come and help me search for the intruder, Filch. Filch, I don’t give a damn about that wretched poltergeist; it’s my office that’s — Pajama party, is it? Shut up! It is unimportant, A student, I daresay, It has happened before. Potion ingredients have gone missing from my private store cupboard . . . students attempting illicit mixtures, no doubt. . . . You know I’m hiding nothing, Moody, as you’ve searched my office pretty thoroughly yourself. Dumbledore happens to trust me, I refuse to believe that he gave you orders to search my office! You don’t have the authority to send me anywhere! I have as much right to prowl this school after dark as you do! Accio Parchment! Potter, Potter! That egg is Potter’s egg. That piece of parchment belongs to Potter. I have seen it before, I recognize it! Potter is here! Potter, in his Invisibility Cloak! What’s that? I merely thought, that if Potter was wandering around after hours again . . . it’s an unfortunate habit of his . . . he should be stopped. For — for his own safety. I think I will go back to bed, Fascinating though your social life undoubtedly is, Miss Granger, I must ask you not to discuss it in my class. Ten points from Gryffindor. Ah . . . reading magazines under the table as well? A further ten points from Gryffindor . . . oh but of course . . . Potter has to keep up with his press cuttings. . . . ‘A boy like no other, perhaps . . .’ he bestows his heart upon a worthier candidate.’ Well, I think I had better separate the three of you, so you can keep your minds on your potions rather than on your tangled love lives. Weasley, you stay here. Miss Granger, over there, beside Miss Parkinson. Potter — that table in front of my desk. Move. Now. All this press attention seems to have inflated your already overlarge head, Potter, You might be laboring under the delusion that the entire Wizarding world is impressed with you, but I don’t care how many times your picture appears in the papers. To me, Potter, you are nothing but a nasty little boy who considers rules to be beneath him. So I give you fair warning, Potter, Boomslang skin. You were out of bed on the night my office was broken into! I know it, Potter! Now, Mad-Eye Moody might have joined your fan club, but I will not tolerate your behavior! One more nighttime stroll into my office, Potter, and you will pay! Do you know what this is, Potter? It is Veritaserum — a Truth Potion so powerful that three drops would have you spilling your innermost secrets for this entire class to hear, Now, the use of this potion is controlled by very strict Ministry guidelines. But unless you watch your step, you might just find that my hand slips right over your evening pumpkin juice. And then, Potter . . . then we’ll find out whether you’ve been in my office or not. Enter, I’ll talk to you after my lesson, Karkaroff, After the lesson, What’s so urgent? Put it away! What? Potter! What are you doing? It’s coming back . . . Karkaroff’s too . . . stronger and clearer than ever . . . When we told Mr. Fudge that we had caught the Death Eater responsible for tonight’s events, he seemed to feel his personal safety was in question. He insisted on summoning a dementor to accompany him into the castle. There, It is not as clear as it was an hour or so ago, when it burned black, but you can still see it. Every Death Eater had the sign burned into him by the Dark Lord. It was a means of distinguishing one another, and his means of summoning us to him. When he touched the Mark of any Death Eater, we were to Disapparate, and Apparate, instantly, at his side. This Mark has been growing clearer all year. Karkaroff’s too. Why do you think Karkaroff fled tonight? We both felt the Mark burn. We both knew he had returned. Karkaroff fears the Dark Lord’s vengeance. He betrayed too many of his fellow Death Eaters to be sure of a welcome back into the fold. Him! What is he doing here? Settle down, Before we begin today’s lesson, I think it appropriate to remind you that next June you will be sitting an important examination, during which you will prove how much you have learned about the composition and use of magical potions. Moronic though some of this class undoubtedly are, I expect you to scrape an ‘Acceptable’ in your O. W.L., or suffer my . . . displeasure. After this year, of course, many of you will cease studying with me, I take only the very best into my N. E.W.T. Potions class, which means that some of us will certainly be saying good-bye. But we have another year to go before that happy moment of farewell, so whether you are intending to attempt N. E.W.T. or not, I advise all of you to concentrate your efforts upon maintaining the high-pass level I have come to expect from my O. W.L. students. Today we will be mixing a potion that often comes up at Ordinary Wizarding Level: the Draught of Peace, a potion to calm anxiety and soothe agitation. Be warned: If you are too heavy-handed with the ingredients you will put the drinker into a heavy and sometimes irreversible sleep, so you will need to pay close attention to what you are doing. you have an hour and a half. . . . Start. A light silver vapor should now be rising from your potion, Potter, what is this supposed to be? Tell me, Potter, can you read? Read the third line of the instructions for me, Potter. Did you do everything on the third line, Potter? I beg your pardon? I know you did, Potter, which means that this mess is utterly worthless. Evanesco. Those of you who have managed to read the instructions, fill one flagon with a sample of your potion, label it clearly with your name, and bring it up to my desk for testing, Homework: twelve inches of parchment on the properties of moonstone and its uses in potion-making, to be handed in on Thursday. I have awarded you the grades you would have received if you presented this work in your O. W.L., This should give you a realistic idea of what to expect in your examination. The general standard of this homework was abysmal. Most of you would have failed had this been your examination. I expect to see a great deal more effort for this week’s essay on the various varieties of venom antidotes, or I shall have to start handing out detentions to those dunces who get D’s. Fighting, Potter, Weasley, Longbottom? Ten points from Gryffindor. Release Longbottom, Potter, or it will be detention. Inside, all of you. You will notice, that we have a guest with us today. Yes, Carry on. Fourteen years, Yes, Obviously. Yes, I suggest you ask him, I suppose this is relevant? No marks again, then, Potter, Sit down, Potter. I was supposed to see you alone, Potter, I am here on Dumbledore’s orders, but by all means stay, Black, I know you like to feel . . . involved. Merely that I am sure you must feel — ah — frustrated by the fact that you can do nothing useful The headmaster has sent me to tell you, Potter, that it is his wish for you to study Occlumency this term. Occlumency, Potter. The magical defense of the mind against external penetration. An obscure branch of magic, but a highly useful one. Because the headmaster thinks it a good idea, You will receive private lessons once a week, but you will not tell anybody what you are doing, least of all Dolores Umbridge. You understand? I am, I suppose because it is a headmaster’s privilege to delegate less enjoyable tasks, I assure you I did not beg for the job. I will expect you at six o’clock on Monday evening, Potter. My office. If anybody asks, you are taking Remedial Potions. Nobody who has seen you in my classes could deny you need them. I am in rather a hurry, Black .. . unlike you I do not have unlimited leisure time . . . How touching, But surely you have noticed that Potter is very like his father? Well then, you’ll know he’s so arrogant that criticism simply bounces off him, Oh, but why don’t you tell him so? Or are you afraid he might not take the advice of a man who has been hiding inside his mother’s house for six months very seriously? Speaking of dogs, did you know that Lucius Malfoy recognized you last time you risked a little jaunt outside? Clever idea, Black, getting yourself seen on a safe station platform . . . gave you a cast-iron excuse not to leave your hidey-hole in future, didn’t it? Why, yes, I suppose I am, Shut the door behind you, Potter. Well, Potter, you know why you are here, The headmaster has asked me to teach you Occlumency. I can only hope that you prove more adept at it than Potions. This may not be an ordinary class, Potter, but I am still your teacher and you will therefore call me ‘sir’ or ‘Professor’ at all times. Now, Occlumency. As I told you back in your dear godfather’s kitchen, this branch of magic seals the mind against magical intrusion and influence. Surely even you could have worked that out by now, Potter? The Dark Lord is highly skilled at Legilimency — It is the ability to extract feelings and memories from another person’s mind — You have no subtlety, Potter, You do not understand fine distinctions. It is one of the shortcomings that makes you such a lamentable potion-maker. Only Muggles talk of ‘mind reading. ’ The mind is not a book, to be opened at will and examined at leisure. Thoughts are not etched on the inside of skulls, to be perused by any invader. The mind is a complex and many-layered thing, Potter . . . or at least, most minds are . . . It is true, however, that those who have mastered Legilimency are able, under certain conditions, to delve into the minds of their victims and to interpret their findings correctly. The Dark Lord, for instance, almost always knows when somebody is lying to him. Only those skilled at Occlumency are able to shut down those feelings and memories that contradict the lie, and so utter falsehoods in his presence without detection. The Dark Lord is at a considerable distance and the walls and grounds of Hogwarts are guarded by many ancient spells and charms to ensure the bodily and mental safety of those who dwell within them, Time and space matter in magic, Potter. Eye contact is often essential to Legilimency. The usual rules do not seem to apply with you, Potter. The curse that failed to kill you seems to have forged some kind of connection between you and the Dark Lord. The evidence suggests that at times, when your mind is most relaxed and vulnerable — when you are asleep, for instance — you are sharing the Dark Lord’s thoughts and emotions. The headmaster thinks it inadvisable for this to continue. He wishes me to teach you how to close your mind to the Dark Lord. It appears that the Dark Lord has been unaware of the connection between you and himself until very recently. Up till now it seems that you have been experiencing his emotions and sharing his thoughts without his being any the wiser. However, the vision you had shortly before Christmas — Do not interrupt me, Potter, As I was saying . . . the vision you had shortly before Christmas represented such a powerful incursion upon the Dark Lord’s thoughts — I thought I just told you not to interrupt me, Potter? Do not say the Dark Lord’s name! Dumbledore is an extremely powerful wizard, While he may feel secure enough to use the name . . . the rest of us . . . You seem to have visited the snake’s mind because that was where the Dark Lord was at that particular moment, He was possessing the snake at the time and so you dreamed you were inside it too . . . It seems so, I told you, to call me ‘sir. ’ It is enough that we know, The important point is that the Dark Lord is now aware that you are gaining access to his thoughts and feelings. He has also deduced that the process is likely to work in reverse; that is to say, he has realized that he might be able to access your thoughts and feelings in return — He might, Which brings us back to Occlumency. Stand up and take out your wand, Potter. You may use your wand to attempt to disarm me, or defend yourself in any other way you can think of, I am about to attempt to break into your mind, We are going to see how well you resist. I have been told that you have already shown aptitude at resisting the Imperius Curse. . . . You will find that similar powers are needed for this. . . . Brace yourself, now. Did you mean to produce a Stinging Hex? Right, You let me get in too far. You lost control. Flashes of it, To whom did the dog belong? Well, for a first attempt that was not as poor as it might have been, You managed to stop me eventually, though you wasted time and energy shouting. Repel me with your brain and you will not need to resort to your wand. Manners, Potter, Now, I want you to close your eyes. Clear your mind, Potter, Let go of all emotion . . . You’re not doing it, Potter. . . . You will need more discipline than this. . . . Focus, now . . . Let’s go again . . . on the count of three . . . one — two — three — Legilimens! Get up! Get up! You are not trying, you are making no effort, you are allowing me access to memories you fear, handing me weapons! I told you to empty yourself of emotion! Then you will find yourself easy prey for the Dark Lord! Fools who wear their hearts proudly on their sleeves, who cannot control their emotions, who wallow in sad memories and allow themselves to be provoked this easily — weak people, in other words — they stand no chance against his powers! He will penetrate your mind with absurd ease, Potter! Then prove it! Master yourself! Control your anger, discipline your mind! We shall try again! Get ready, now! Legilimens! What happened then, Potter? What? what did you say? And why, would you ask such a thing? I have told you not to say the Dark Lord’s name! I want you back here same time on Wednesday, and we will continue work then. You understand? And be warned, Potter . . . I shall know if you have not practiced . . . Get up, Potter. What? That’s right, I mean the one concerning a man kneeling in the middle of a darkened room . . . How do that man and that room come to be inside your head, Potter? A dream, You do know why we are here, don’t you, Potter? You do know why I am giving up my evenings to this tedious job? Remind me why we are here, Potter. Correct, Potter. And dim though you may be I would have thought that after two months’ worth of lessons you might have made some progress. How many other dreams about the Dark Lord have you had? Perhaps, perhaps you actually enjoy having these visions and dreams, Potter. Maybe they make you feel special — important? That is just as well, Potter, because you are neither special nor important, and it is not up to you to find out what the Dark Lord is saying to his Death Eaters. Yes, Potter, That is my job. Now, if you are ready, we will start again . . . One — two — three — Legilimens! ENOUGH! Reparo! Well, Potter . . . that was certainly an improvement . . . I don’t remember telling you to use a Shield Charm . . . but there is no doubt that it was effective . . . Let’s try again, shall we? One — two — three — Legilimens! POTTER! Explain yourself! You are not working hard enough! You are lazy and sloppy, Potter, it is small wonder that the Dark Lord — What the — ? Did you see anything unusual on your way down here, Potter? You’re late, Potter, So, Have you been practicing? Well, we’ll soon find out, won’t we? It’s all right, Draco, Potter is here for a little Remedial Potions. So, How did he get in there? Good, So... So . . . been enjoying yourself, Potter? Amusing man, your father, wasn’t he? You will not tell anybody what you saw! Get out, get out, I don’t want to see you in this office ever again! You wanted to see me, Headmistress? You took my last bottle to interrogate Potter, Surely you did not use it all? I told you that three drops would be sufficient. Certainly, It takes a full moon cycle to mature, so I should have it ready for you in around a month. Really? Well, it doesn’t surprise me. Potter has never shown much inclination to follow school rules. I have already told you, that I have no further stocks of Veritaserum. Unless you wish to poison Potter — and I assure you I would have the greatest sympathy with you if you did — I cannot help you. The only trouble is that most venoms act too fast to give the victim much time for truth-telling . . . I have no idea, Potter! What are you doing, Potter? Put that wand away at once, Ah. I see there are no longer any points left in the Gryffindor hourglass to take away. In that case, Potter, we will simply have to — Professor McGonagall! Out of St. Mungo’s, I see! What? Oh — well — I suppose . . . Well, well, well, Nice of you to turn up, Potter, although you have evidently decided that the wearing of school robes would detract from your appearance. Hagrid was late for the start-of-term feast, just like Potter here, so I took it instead. And incidentally, I was interested to see your new Patronus. I think you were better off with the old one, The new one looks weak. Inside, I have not asked you to take out your books, I wish to speak to you, and I want your fullest attention. You have had five teachers in this subject so far, I believe. Naturally, these teachers will all have had their own methods and priorities. I shall be even more surprised if all of you manage to keep up with the N. E.W.T. work, which will be much more advanced. The Dark Arts, are many, varied, ever-changing, and eternal. Fighting them is like fighting a many-headed monster, which, each time a neck is severed, sprouts a head even fiercer and cleverer than before. You are fighting that which is unfixed, mutating, indestructible. The Dark Lord has used Inferi in the past, which means you would be well-advised to assume he might use them again. Now . . . . . . you are, I believe, complete novices in the use of nonverbal spells. What is the advantage of a nonverbal spell? Very well — Miss Granger? An answer copied almost word for word from The Standard Book of Spells, Grade Six, but correct in essentials. Yes, those who progress to using magic without shouting incantations gain an element of surprise in their spell-casting. Not all wizards can do this, of course; it is a question of concentration and mind power which some lack. You will now divide into pairs. One partner will attempt to jinx the other without speaking. The other will attempt to repel the jinx in equal silence. Carry on. Pathetic, Weasley, Do you remember me telling you we are practicing nonverbal spells, Potter? Yes, sir. Potter I do not take cheek from anyone, Potter . . . not even ‘the Chosen One. ’ Funny, I never had the impression that I managed to teach Potter anything at all. were you? All the subjects required, in short, for an Auror, I’d like a word with you, Draco, I’m his Head of House, and I shall decide how hard, or otherwise, to be, Follow me, Draco. Late again, Potter, Ten points from Gryffindor. Before we start, I want your dementor essays, And I hope for your sakes they are better than the tripe I had to endure on resisting the Imperius Curse. Now, if you will all open your books to page — what is it, Mr. Finnigan? No, there wasn’t, If you had actually read the article in question, Mr. Finnigan, you would have known that the so-called Inferius was nothing but a smelly sneak thief by the name of Mundungus Fletcher. But Potter seems to have a lot to say on the subject, Let us ask Potter how we would tell the difference between an Inferius and a ghost. Oh, very good, Yes, it is easy to see that nearly six years of magical education have not been wasted on you, Potter. ‘Ghosts are transparent. ’ A five-year-old could have told us as much, The Inferius is a corpse that has been reanimated by a Dark wizard’s spells. It is not alive, it is merely used like a puppet to do the wizard’s bidding. A ghost, as I trust that you are all aware by now, is the imprint of a departed soul left upon the earth . . . and of course, as Potter so wisely tells us, transparent. Another ten points from Gryffindor. I would expect nothing more sophisticated from you, Ronald Weasley, the boy so solid he cannot Apparate half an inch across a room. Now open your books to page two hundred and thirteen, and read the first two paragraphs on the Cruciatus Curse. . . . You need the hospital wing. There may be a certain amount of scarring, but if you take dittany immediately we might avoid even that. . . . Come. . . . Go, Apparently I underestimated you, Potter, Who would have thought you knew such Dark Magic? Who taught you that spell? Where? Liar, Bring me your schoolbag, and all of your schoolbooks. All of them. Bring them to me here. Now! This is your copy of Advanced Potion-Making, is it, Potter? You’re quite sure of that, are you, Potter? This is the copy of Advanced Potion-Making that you purchased from Flourish and Blotts? Then why, does it have the name ‘Roonil Wazlib’ written inside the front cover? Your nickname, I understand what a nickname is, Do you know what I think, Potter? What do you think, Potter? Well, we shall see how you feel after your detentions, Ten o’clock Saturday morning, Potter. My office. Ten o’clock, Poor Gryffindor . . . fourth place this year, I fear . . . Ah, Mr. Filch has been looking for someone to clear out these old files, They are the records of other Hogwarts wrongdoers and their punishments. Where the ink has grown faint, or the cards have suffered damage from mice, we would like you to copy out the crimes and punishments afresh and, making sure that they are in alphabetical order, replace them in the boxes. You will not use magic. I thought you could start, with boxes one thousand and twelve to one thousand and fifty-six. You will find some familiar names in there, which should add interest to the task. Here, you see . . . ‘James Potter and Sirius Black. Apprehended using an illegal hex upon Bertram Aubrey. Aubrey’s head twice normal size. Double detention.  It must be such a comfort to think that, though they are gone, a record of their great achievements remains. . . . I think that will do, Mark the place you have reached. You will continue at ten o’clock next Saturday. Out of here, quickly, It’s over, time to go! Run, Draco! No Unforgivable Curses from you, Potter! Coward, did you call me, Potter? Your father would never attack me unless it was four on one, what would you call him, I wonder? Harry! Now come! It is time to be gone, before the Ministry turns up — No! Have you forgotten our orders? Potter belongs to the Dark Lord — we are to leave him! Go! Go! No, Potter! You dare use my own spells against me, Potter? It was I who invented them — I, the Half-Blood Prince! And you’d turn my inventions on me, like your filthy father, would you? I don’t think so . . . no! CALL ME COWARD! It is I, Where are the Carrows? I was under the impression, that Alecto had apprehended an intruder. I did not know that it was your night to patrol the corridors, Minerva. I wonder what could have brought you out of your bed at this late hour? Really? But all seems calm. Have you seen Harry Potter, Minerva? Because if you have, I must insist —",

You’re going to de-gnome the garden for me; they’re getting completely out of hand again — You can go up to bed, dear,You didn’t ask them to fly that wretched car — That’s very sweet of you, dear, but it’s dull work, Now, let’s see what Lockhart’s got to say on the subject — Oh, he is marvelous, He knows his household pests, all right, it’s a wonderful book. . . . Did Lucius Malfoy buy anything? So he’s worried, Oh, I’d love to get Lucius Malfoy for something. . . . So you don’t think I’m a match for Lucius Malfoy? But you’re Muggles! We must have a drink! What’s that you’ve got there? Oh, you’re changing Muggle money. Molly, look! Harry! How are you? No, They’ve pulled us all off our regular jobs at the Ministry to try and find him, but no luck so far. Harry! Black’s not going to be caught by a thirteen-year-old wizard. It’s the Azkaban guards who’ll get him back, you mark my words. That’s enough, now, They’re here, Harry, come on. Harry, come over here a moment. There’s something I’ve got to tell you before you leave — You know? How could you know? That’s not the way I’d have chosen for you to find out, Harry, I’m not trying to be a hero, but seriously, Sirius Black can’t be worse than Voldemort, can he? Harry, He’s coming, Molly! Listen, I want you to give me your word — Harry, Harry, Swear to me that whatever you might hear — Ouch! Fred, no — go back, go back, there’s been some kind of mistake — tell George not to — OUCH! George, no, there’s no room, go back quickly and tell Ron — Damn! What on earth did they want to block up the fireplace for? Really? Eclectic, you say? With a plug? Gracious, I must see that. . . . Let’s think . . . ouch, Ron! Boys, boys . . . I’m trying to think what to do. . . . Yes . . . only way . . . Stand back, Harry. That’s better, Ah — you must be Harry’s aunt and uncle! Er — yes — sorry about that, It’s all my fault. It just didn’t occur to me that we wouldn’t be able to get out at the other end. I had your fireplace connected to the Floo Network, you see — just for an afternoon, you know, so we could get Harry. Muggle fireplaces aren’t supposed to be connected, strictly speaking — but I’ve got a useful contact at the Floo Regulation Panel and he fixed it for me. I can put it right in a jiffy, though, don’t worry. I’ll light a fire to send the boys back, and then I can repair your fireplace before I Disapparate. Hello, Harry! Got your trunk ready? Well, Very — erm — very nice place you’ve got here. They run off eckeltricity, do they? Ah yes, I can see the plugs. I collect plugs, And batteries. Got a very large collection of batteries. My wife thinks I’m mad, but there you are. Harry? Having a good holiday, Dudley? Ah, right, Better get cracking then. Incendio! Off you go then, Fred, Right then, George, you and the trunk. Ron, you next, Harry said good-bye to you, Didn’t you hear him? You aren’t going to see your nephew till next summer, Surely you’re going to say good-bye? Not to worry, I can sort him out! It doesn’t matter, It’s a simple process — it was the toffee — my son Fred — real practical joker — but it’s only an Engorgement Charm — at least, I think it is — please, I can correct it — Now really! I’m trying to help! Harry, go! Just go! I’ll sort this out! That wasn’t funny, Fred! What on earth did you give that Muggle boy? You dropped it on purpose! You knew he’d eat it, you knew he was on a diet — It was four feet long before his parents would let me shrink it! It isn’t funny! That sort of behavior seriously undermines wizard–Muggle relations! I spend half my life campaigning against the mistreatment of Muggles, and my own sons — It’s nothing, Molly, What d’you think? We’re supposed to go incognito — do I look like a Muggle, Harry? Oh yes, The Department of Magical Transportation had to fine a couple of people the other day for Apparating without a license. It’s not easy, Apparition, and when it’s not done properly it can lead to nasty complications. This pair I’m talking about went and Splinched themselves. They left half of themselves behind, So, of course, they were stuck. Couldn’t move either way. Had to wait for the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad to sort them out. Meant a fair old bit of paperwork, I can tell you, what with the Muggles who spotted the body parts they’d left behind. . . . Oh yes, You don’t mess around with Apparition. There are plenty of adult wizards who don’t bother with it. Prefer brooms — slower, but safer. We’ve got a bit of a walk, No, no, that’s miles away, We only need to walk a short way. It’s just that it’s very difficult for a large number of wizards to congregate without attracting Muggle attention. We have to be very careful about how we travel at the best of times, and on a huge occasion like the Quidditch World Cup — It’s been a massive organizational problem, The trouble is, about a hundred thousand wizards turn up at the World Cup, and of course, we just haven’t got a magical site big enough to accommodate them all. First, of course, we have to stagger the arrivals. People with cheaper tickets have to arrive two weeks beforehand. A limited number use Muggle transport, but we can’t have too many clogging up their buses and trains — remember, wizards are coming from all over the world. Some Apparate, of course, but we have to set up safe points for them to appear, well away from Muggles. I believe there’s a handy wood they’re using as the Apparition point. For those who don’t want to Apparate, or can’t, we use Portkeys. They’re objects that are used to transport wizards from one spot to another at a prearranged time. You can do large groups at a time if you need to. There have been two hundred Portkeys placed at strategic points around Britain, and the nearest one to us is up at the top of Stoatshead Hill, so that’s where we’re headed. Well, they can be anything, Unobtrusive things, obviously, so Muggles don’t go picking them up and playing with them . . . stuff they’ll just think is litter. . . . Whew, Well, we’ve made good time — we’ve got ten minutes. . . . Now we just need the Portkey, It won’t be big. . . . Come on . . . Over here, Arthur! Over here, son, we’ve got it! Amos! He works for the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. And I think you know his son, Cedric? Not too bad, We live just on the other side of the village there. You? Oh no, only the redheads, This is Hermione, friend of Ron’s — and Harry, another friend — Ced’s talked about you, of course, Must be nearly time, Do you know whether we’re waiting for any more, Amos? Not that I know of, Yes, it’s a minute off. . . . We’d better get ready. . . . You just need to touch the Portkey, that’s all, a finger will do — Three . . . two . . . one . . . Morning! Morning, Would you be Mr. Roberts? Weasley — two tents, booked a couple of days ago? That’s it, Help me, Harry, This one’s a — a — a ten? Ah yes, I see the little number on it now. . . . So this is a five? Foreign? Foreign? Foreign? Did you really? Is that right? Shouldn’t he? Thanks very much, He should, but Ludo’s always been a bit . . . well . . . lax about security. You couldn’t wish for a more enthusiastic Head of the sports department though. He played Quidditch for England himself, you know. And he was the best Beater the Wimbourne Wasps ever had. Oops! From the Department of Mysteries, top secret, no idea what they get up to. . . . Harry! The man of the moment! Ludo! Ah — yes, this is my son Percy. Everyone, Oh . . . go on then, Let’s see . . . a Galleon on Ireland to win? They’re a bit young to be gambling, Boys, I don’t want you betting. . . . That’s all your savings. . . . Your mother — You don’t think it might be time to send someone to look for her? I sent him an owl about that just last week. If I’ve told him once I’ve told him a hundred times: Carpets are defined as a Muggle Artifact by the Registry of Proscribed Charmable Objects, but will he listen? I expect you’ll both be glad when this is over? You’ll find out soon enough, It’s time! Come on, let’s go! Seats a hundred thousand, Ministry task force of five hundred have been working on it all year. Muggle Repelling Charms on every inch of it. Every time Muggles have got anywhere near here all year, they’ve suddenly remembered urgent appointments and had to dash away again . . . bless them, Oh that’s always worth watching, National teams bring creatures from their native land, you know, to put on a bit of a show. How — how nice, I wonder what they’ve brought, Aaah! Veela! once Ireland have had their say. You’ll be wanting that, Leprechauns! Fingers in your ears! Fool! Krum was feinting! And that, boys, is why you should never go for looks alone! We’re going to help the Ministry! You lot — get into the woods, and stick together. I’ll come and fetch you when we’ve sorted this out! Stop! STOP! That’s my son! Hermione — are you all right? Where did the Mark come from, you three? Come off it, Amos, you don’t seriously think it was the elf? The Dark Mark’s a wizard’s sign. It requires a wand. Er — what? Amos, think who you’re talking to! Is Harry Potter likely to conjure the Dark Mark? Amos, think about it . . . precious few wizards know how to do that spell. . . . Where would she have learned it? Winky? She might have picked it up anywhere. . . . Winky? Where exactly did you find Harry’s wand? You see, Amos? Whoever conjured the Mark could have Disapparated right after they’d done it, leaving Harry’s wand behind. A clever thing to do, not using their own wand, which could have betrayed them. And Winky here had the misfortune to come across the wand moments later and pick it up. Amos, Amos, that wand’s told us all it can — if Harry could have it back, please — I don’t know, We found Barty Crouch’s elf holding Harry’s wand, but we’re none the wiser about who actually conjured the Mark. And it hasn’t been seen for thirteen years, Of course people panicked . . . it was almost like seeing You-Know-Who back again. Ron, You-Know-Who and his followers sent the Dark Mark into the air whenever they killed, The terror it inspired . . . you have no idea, you’re too young. Just picture coming home and finding the Dark Mark hovering over your house, and knowing what you’re about to find inside. . . . Everyone’s worst fear . . . the very worst . . . We can’t prove it was them, Bill, Though it probably was, Sorry, What were You-Know-Who’s supporters up to, levitating Muggles? I mean, what was the point? The point? Harry, that’s their idea of fun. Half the Muggle killings back when You-Know-Who was in power were done for fun. A nice little reunion for them, Your guess is as good as ours, Hermione, But I’ll tell you this . . . it was only the Death Eaters who ever knew how to conjure it. I’d be very surprised if the person who did it hadn’t been a Death Eater once, even if they’re not now. . . . Listen, it’s very late, and if your mother hears what’s happened she’ll be worried sick. We’ll get a few more hours sleep and then try and get an early Portkey out of here. I knew it, I’m mentioned, If the terrified wizards and witches who waited breathlessly for news at the edge of the wood expected reassurance from the Ministry of Magic, they were sadly disappointed. Rumors that several bodies were removed from the woods . . . well, there certainly will be rumors now she’s printed that.” Molly, I’m going to have to go into the office; this is going to take some smoothing over. I’ve got to go, Molly, I’ve made things worse. I’ll just change into my robes and I’ll be off. . . . always the same — we can’t resist showing off when we get together. . . . Harry! Good to see you! I’m sure they’d never go over to You-Know-Who, They’ve suffered losses too. Remember that goblin family he murdered last time, somewhere near Nottingham? Arthur! Arthur, back me up! But they’re legally adults now, Ah, well, you’ve put your finger on the problem, Dumbledore. Frightened of what he’s up to, You see, Fudge thinks Dumbledore’s plotting to overthrow him. He thinks Dumbledore wants to be Minister of Magic. Of course he doesn’t, He’s never wanted the Minister’s job, even though a lot of people wanted him to take it when Millicent Bagnold retired. Fudge came to power instead, but he’s never quite forgotten how much popular support Dumbledore had, even though Dumbledore never applied for the job. Sirius? Tonks here, for one — she’s too young to have been in the Order of the Phoenix last time, and having Aurors on our side is a huge advantage — Kingsley Shacklebolt’s been a real asset too. He’s in charge of the hunt for Sirius, so he’s been feeding the Ministry information that Sirius is in Tibet. It’s no laughing matter, If he carries on defying the Ministry like this, he could end up in Azkaban and the last thing we want is Dumbledore locked up. While You-Know-Who knows Dumbledore’s out there and wise to what he’s up to, he’s going to go cautiously for a while. If Dumbledore’s out of the way — well, You-Know-Who will have a clear field. “You can wait in my office until it’s time for the hearing,” “He came last night, when you were in bed,” I’ll cover for you, I’m okay, I’ve got a report to finish anyway . . . How are you feeling? It’ll all be over soon, In a few hours’ time you’ll be cleared. The hearing’s on my floor, in Amelia Bones’s office. She’s Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and she’s the one who’ll be questioning you. Doesn’t it ever lie flat? No, I usually Apparate, but obviously you can’t, and I think it’s best we arrive in a thoroughly non-magical fashion . . . makes a better impression, given what you’re being disciplined for . . . Simply fabulous, Wonderfully ingenious. Yes, but even so . . . Where are we? Ah yes . . . this way, Harry, Sorry, but I never come by train and it all looks rather different from a Muggle perspective. As a matter of fact I’ve never even used the visitor’s entrance before. Here we are, After you, Harry. No, no, I’m sure it’s fine, Let’s see . . . six . . . he dialed the number, two . . . four . . . and another four . . . and another two . . . Er . . . Arthur Weasley, Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office, here to escort Harry Potter, who has been asked to attend a disciplinary hearing . . . This way, Ah yes . . . this way, Harry, I’m escorting a visitor, Thank you, Eric, What’ve you got there, Bob? Just Interdepartmental memos, We used to use owls, but the mess was unbelievable . . . droppings all over the desks . . . This is us, Harry, My office is on the other side of the floor. Yes, those are enchanted windows; Magical Maintenance decide what weather we’re getting every day. We had two months of hurricanes last time they were angling for a pay raise. . . . Just round here, Harry. Yes, if it really is a second, I’m in rather a hurry. If you had read my report you would know that the term is ‘firearms,’ And I’m afraid you’ll have to wait for information on motorcycles, we’re extremely busy at the moment. If you can get away before seven, Molly’s making meatballs. We haven’t got a window, We’ve asked, but they don’t seem to think we need one. Have a seat, Harry, doesn’t look as if Perkins is in yet. Ah, yes . . . Yes, he’s right, I’m sure Sirius will find that very amusing — oh dear, what’s this now? ‘Third regurgitating public toilet reported in Bethnal Green, kindly investigate immediately. ’ This is getting ridiculous . . . Anti-Muggle pranksters, We had two last week, one in Wimbledon, one in Elephant and Castle. Muggles are pulling the flush and instead of everything disappearing — well, you can imagine. The poor things keep calling in those — those pumbles, I think they’re called — you know, the ones who mend pipes and things — — exactly, yes, but of course they’re flummoxed. I only hope we can catch whoever’s doing it. Ah, I know about the regurgitating toilet, Down in old — but they told me — Merlin’s beard — Quick, Harry, we should have been there five minutes ago! Come ON! Those courtrooms haven’t been used in years, I can’t think why they’re doing it down there — unless — but no . . . Urgent business, Bode, Dumbledore didn’t say — Harry, that’s wonderful! Well, of course, they couldn’t have found you guilty, not on the evidence, but even so, I can’t pretend I wasn’t — I’m going to take you straight back so you can tell the others the good news, I’ll drop you off on the way to that toilet in Bethnal Green. Come on . . . Oh, it’s a simple enough anti-jinx, but it’s not so much having to repair the damage, it’s more the attitude behind the vandalism, Harry. Muggle-baiting might strike some wizards as funny, but it’s an expression of something much deeper and nastier, and I for one — I work here, No, Trying to sneak down to the courtroom, if you ask me, Trying to find out whether you’d been expelled or not. I’ll leave a note for Dumbledore when I drop you off, he ought to know Malfoy’s been talking to Fudge again. Gold, I expect, Malfoy’s been giving generously to all sorts of things for years. . . . Gets him in with the right people . . . then he can ask favors . . . delay laws he doesn’t want passed . . . Oh, he’s very well connected, Lucius Malfoy . . . Don’t think it hadn’t occurred to us, Harry, But Dumbledore thinks Fudge is acting of his own accord at the moment — which, as Dumbledore says, is not a lot of comfort. . . . Best not talk about it anymore just now, Harry . . . Listen, Sirius, Lucius Malfoy was at the Ministry — Be quiet, you three! Yes, we saw him talking to Fudge on level nine, then they went up to Fudge’s office together. Dumbledore ought to know. ‘— an immediate success, totally revolutionizing the teaching of Defense Against the Dark Arts and providing the Minister with on-the-ground feedback about what’s really happening at Hogwarts. ’ Fine, You — er — haven’t seen Healer Smethwyck, have you? You know, Well . . . well, I don’t know whether you know what — what stitches are? See you Harry, and keep an eye out for snakes for me! Ah, Harry! Well — shall we do it, then? Yes, But I would say that even if I were a Death Eater, dear. Ask the question! Molly! To find out how airplanes stay up. Molly! I’ve got to ask you your question first! What do you like me to call you when we’re alone together? Correct, Now you can let me in. I know, dear, but it’s Ministry procedure, and I have to set an example. Something smells good — onion soup? Harry! We didn’t expect you until morning! Thanks, Molly. It’s been a tough night. Some idiot’s started selling Metamorph-Medals. Just sling them around your neck and you’ll be able to change your appearance at will. A hundred thousand disguises, all for ten Galleons! Mostly you just turn a fairly unpleasant orange color, but a couple of people have also sprouted tentaclelike warts all over their bodies. As if St. Mungo’s didn’t have enough to do already! Of course I am! The boys wouldn’t do anything like that now, not when people are desperate for protection! Yes, G’night, Harry, Talking of Diagon Alley, looks like Ollivander’s gone too. That’s the one. Shop’s empty. No sign of a struggle. No one knows whether he left voluntarily or was kidnapped. Of course, Harry, please. You’re talking to the man who raised Fred and George. Very well, then, let’s hear the worst. Of course you did, Well? Did you find out why? Harry, I doubt whether You-Know-Who would allow a sixteen-year-old — I doubt it, to be honest, Harry, You see, when Lucius Malfoy was arrested, we raided his house. We took away everything that might have been dangerous. Well, maybe, You’d better hurry, Harry, quickly! Shall we have a nightcap, then? Who wants eggnog? What? Arthur, he’s — he’s with the Minister! Half our family does seem to owe you their lives, now I stop and think about it, Well, all I can say is that it was a lucky day for the Weasleys when Ron decided to sit in your compartment on the Hogwarts Express, Harry. You said Greyback attacked him? But he hadn’t transformed? So what does that mean? What will happen to Bill? And Dumbledore . . . Minerva, is it true . . . Is he really . . . ? Dumbledore’s dead Please be careful, Hagrid, I’m still not sure that was advisable and it’s certainly only to be used in emergencies. I’ll prove who I am, Kingsley, after I’ve seen my son, now back off if you know what’s good for you! How is he? Mad-Eye, Dead. There are a dozen places you might be now, Harry, He’s got no way of knowing which safe house you’re in. We know that, but it would make our efforts tonight seem rather pointless if you left. when you’re in a pressured situation  you can produce magic you never dreamed of. Small children often find, before they’re trained — And as there are around twenty of us, that greatly dilutes the power of the Fidelius Charm. Twenty times as many opportunities for the Death Eaters to get the secret out of somebody. We can’t expect it to hold much longer. Well, Mad-Eye set up a couple of curses against Snape in case he turns up there again. We hope they’ll be strong enough both to keep him out and to bind his tongue if he tries to talk about the place, but we can’t be sure. It would have been insane to keep using the place as headquarters now that its protection has become so shaky. The latter, I think. Scrimgeour doesn’t want to admit that You-Know-Who is as powerful as he is, nor that Azkaban’s seen a mass breakout. Of course, Ron, but people are terrified, terrified that they will be next to disappear, their children the next to be attacked! There are nasty rumors going around; I for one don’t believe the Muggle Studies professor at Hogwarts resigned. She hasn’t been seen for weeks now. Meanwhile Scrimgeour remains shut up in his office all day: I just hope he’s working on a plan. Minister of Magic coming with me. Yes, of course, The, er, sitting room, why don’t you use that? We — we thought we heard — began Mr. Weasley, looking thoroughly alarmed at the sight of Harry and the Minister virtually nose to nose. What? One moment, Runcorn. I hear you laid information about Dirk Cresswell. Don’t pretend, Runcorn, You tracked down the wizard who faked his family tree, didn’t you? And if he survives Azkaban, you’ll have to answer to him, not to mention his wife, his sons, and his friends — That’s a good idea, Ginny, you stay in this room, you hear me? They must have gone up to the Great Hall already,",

You realize, of course, that nothing we do will be able to keep out You-Know-Who indefinitely?

Professor McGonagall I see what McGonagall meant . . . you really are a natural. I’m just going to teach you the rules this evening, then you’ll be joining team practice three times a week. Right, Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if it’s not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side. Three of them are called Chasers. This ball’s called the Quaffle, The Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops. Follow me? What’s basketball? Now, there’s another player on each side who’s called the Keeper — I’m Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring. I’ll show you now, Take this. I’m going to show you what the Bludgers do, These two are the Bludgers. Stand back, The Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off their brooms. That’s why you have two Beaters on each team — the Weasley twins are ours — it’s their job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team. So — think you’ve got all that? Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the goalposts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team Very good,” Don’t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers — I mean, they’re like a pair of human Bludgers themselves. This, is the Golden Snitch, and it’s the most important ball of the lot. It’s very hard to catch because it’s so fast and difficult to see. It’s the Seeker’s job to catch it. That’s why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages — I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep. Well, that’s it — any questions? Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch, We don’t want you attacked before you have to be. “Don’t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch it’s now. Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much.” What makes you say that? We’re being flattened. Fred, George, where were you when that Bludger stopped Angelina scoring? But the Bludgers have been locked in Madam Hooch’s office since our last practice, and there was nothing wrong with them then. . . . All right, Fred, George, you heard Harry — leave him alone and let him deal with the Bludger on his own. This is our last chance — my last chance — to win the Quidditch Cup, I’ll be leaving at the end of this year. I’ll never get another shot at it. Gryffindor hasn’t won for seven years now. Okay, so we’ve had the worst luck in the world — injuries — then the tournament getting called off last year. . . . But we also know we’ve got the best — ruddy — team — in — the — school, We’ve got three superb Chasers. We’ve got two unbeatable Beaters. And we’ve got a Seeker who has never failed to win us a match! And me, The point is, the Quidditch Cup should have had our name on it these last two years. Ever since Harry joined the team, I’ve thought the thing was in the bag. But we haven’t got it, and this year’s the last chance we’ll get to finally see our name on the thing. . . . Flint’s excuse is that their Seeker’s arm’s still injured, But it’s obvious why they’re doing it. Don’t want to play in this weather. Think it’ll damage their chances. . . . I know that, but we can’t prove it, And we’ve been practicing all those moves assuming we’re playing Slytherin, and instead it’s Hufflepuff, and their style’s quite different. They’ve got a new Captain and Seeker, Cedric Diggory — Why? We were playing in completely different conditions! Diggory’s put a very strong side together! He’s an excellent Seeker! I was afraid you’d take it like this! We mustn’t relax! We must keep our focus! Slytherin is trying to wrong-foot us! We must win! It’s going to be a tough one, I called for time-out! Come on, under here — We’re fifty points up, but unless we get the Snitch soon, we’ll be playing into the night. Harry! Harry, behind you! “Come on! “Faster!” Bad news, Harry. I’ve just been to see Professor McGonagall about the Firebolt. She — er — got a bit shirty with me. Told me I’d got my priorities wrong. Seemed to think I cared more about winning the Cup than I do about you staying alive. Just because I told her I didn’t care if it threw you off, as long as you caught the Snitch first. Honestly, the way she was yelling at me . . . you’d think I’d said something terrible. . . . Then I asked her how much longer she was going to keep it. . . . ‘As long as necessary, Wood’ . . . I reckon it’s time you ordered a new broom, Harry. There’s an order form at the back of Which Broomstick . . . you could get a Nimbus Two Thousand and One, like Malfoy’s got. Er — Madam Hooch? Is it okay if Harry has the Firebolt back? We need to practice. . . . Harry, I’ve just found out who Ravenclaw is playing as Seeker. It’s Cho Chang. She’s a fourth year, and she’s pretty good. . . . I really hoped she wouldn’t be fit, she’s had some problems with injuries. . . . On the other hand, she rides a Comet Two Sixty, which is going to look like a joke next to the Firebolt. Okay, everyone, let’s go — Harry, I’m letting the Snitch out! I can’t see what’s going to stop us tomorrow! Not unless — Harry, you’ve sorted out your dementor problem, haven’t you? Well, let’s hope not, Anyway — good work, everyone. Let’s get back to the tower . . . turn in early — Put it here, Harry, HARRY, THIS IS NO TIME TO BE A GENTLEMAN! KNOCK HER OFF HER BROOM IF YOU HAVE TO! That’s my boy! So you must catch it only if we’re more than fifty points up, Only if we’re more than fifty points up, Harry, or we win the match but lose the Cup. You’ve got that, haven’t you? You must catch the Snitch only if we’re — Team! Bed! Where were you? We had to use Neville instead!",

And she’s really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood’s, last year only a reserve — back to Johnson and — no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes — Flint flying like an eagle up there — he’s going to sc– no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle — that’s Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and — OUCH — that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger — Quaffle taken by the Slytherins — that’s Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goalposts, but he’s blocked by a second Bludger — sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can’t tell which — nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes — she’s really flying — dodges a speeding Bludger — the goalposts are ahead — come on, now, Angelina — Keeper Bletchley dives — misses — GRYFFINDOR SCORE! Slytherin in possession, “They oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the air.” “So — after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating —” “I mean, after that open and revolting foul —” All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I’m sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinnet, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession. Slytherin in possession — Flint with the Quaffle — passes Spinnet — passes Bell — hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose — only joking, Professor — Slytherins score — oh no . . . They’re off, and the big excitement this match is the Firebolt that Harry Potter is flying for Gryffindor. According to Which Broomstick, the Firebolt’s going to be the broom of choice for the national teams at this year’s World Championship — Okay, okay, Gryffindor in possession, Katie Bell of Gryffindor heading for goal . . . Gryffindor leads by eighty points to zero, and look at that Firebolt go! Come on, Harry! Party! Gryffindor common room, now! and Potter, Bell, Johnson, Spinnet, Weasley, Weasley, and Wood. Widely acknowledged as the best team Hogwarts has seen in a good few years — And here come the Slytherin team, led by Captain Flint. He’s made some changes in the lineup and seems to be going for size rather than skill — Quaffle intercepted by Warrington, Warrington of Slytherin tearing up the field — WHAM! — nice Bludger work there by George Weasley, Warrington drops the Quaffle, it’s caught by — Johnson, Gryffindor back in possession, come on, Angelina — nice swerve around Montague — duck, Angelina, that’s a Bludger! — SHE SCORES! TEN–ZERO TO GRYFFINDOR! Come on, Alicia!  TEN–ZERO TO GRYFFINDOR! ’Course, Wood’s a superb Keeper! Superb! Very difficult to pass — very difficult indeed — YES! I DON’T BELIEVE IT! HE’S SAVED IT! Gryffindor in possession, no, Slytherin in possession — no! — Gryffindor back in possession and it’s Katie Bell, Katie Bell for Gryffindor with the Quaffle, she’s streaking up the field — THAT WAS DELIBERATE! I’m telling it like it is, Professor! Ha haaa! Too bad, boys! You’ll need to get up earlier than that to beat a Firebolt! And it’s Gryffindor in possession again, as Johnson takes the Quaffle — Flint alongside her — poke him in the eye, Angelina! — it was a joke, Professor, it was a joke — oh no — Flint in possession, Flint flying toward the Gryffindor goalposts, come on now, Wood, save — ! Sorry, Professor, sorry! Won’t happen again! So, Gryffindor in the lead, thirty points to ten, and Gryffindor in possession — YOU CHEATING SCUM! YOU FILTHY, CHEATING B — Slytherin in possession, Slytherin heading for goal — Montague scores — Seventy–twenty to Gryffindor. . . . Angelina Johnson gets the Quaffle for Gryffindor, come on, Angelina, COME ON! AAAAAAARRRGH! SHE SCORES! SHE SCORES! Gryffindor leads by eighty points to twenty! Supercool, We had him this afternoon, He knows, man, ’Mazing, We’re going to split the thousand Galleons between the three of us if one of us wins, Any second, Blimey, this is heavy, Open it, Harry, go on! Let’s just see what’s inside it! Nice dog, Harry! Calm down, Hermione, they’re fine! Blimey, Harry! I never knew that! Well, once a week sounds cool, And it’s Johnson, Johnson with the Quaffle, what a player that girl is, I’ve been saying it for years but she still won’t go out with me — Just a fun fact, Professor, adds a bit of interest — and she’s ducked Warrington, she’s passed Montague, she’s — ouch — been hit from behind by a Bludger from Crabbe. . . . Montague catches the Quaffle, Montague heading back up the pitch and — nice Bludger there from George Weasley, that’s a Bludger to the head for Montague, he drops the Quaffle, caught by Katie Bell, Katie Bell of Gryffindor reverse passes to Alicia Spinnet and Spinnet’s away — — dodges Warrington, avoids a Bludger — close call, Alicia — and the crowd are loving this, just listen to them, what’s that they’re singing? — and Alicia passes back to Angelina! Come on now, Angelina — looks like she’s got just the Keeper to beat! — SHE SHOOTS — SHE — aaaah . . . — and it’s Warrington with the Quaffle, Warrington heading for goal, he’s out of Bludger range with just the Keeper ahead — — so it’s the first test for new Gryffindor Keeper, Weasley, brother of Beaters, Fred and George, and a promising new talent on the team — come on, Ron! Slytherin score! So that’s ten-nil to Slytherin — bad luck, Ron . . . — and Gryffindor back in possession and it’s Katie Bell tanking up the pitch — — and it’s Warrington again, — and Pucey’s dodged Alicia again, and he’s heading straight for goal, stop it, Ron! It’s forty–ten, forty–ten to Slytherin and Pucey has the Quaffle . . . — Pucey throws to Warrington, Warrington to Montague, Montague back to Pucey — Johnson intervenes, Johnson takes the Quaffle, Johnson to Bell, this looks good — I mean bad — Bell’s hit by a Bludger from Goyle of Slytherin and it’s Pucey in possession again . . . Exploding Snap’s got nothing to do with Defense Against the Dark Arts, Professor! That’s not information relating to your subject! Ah well, . . . apologize for our temporary absence from the airwaves, which was due to a number of house calls in our area by those charming Death Eaters. . . . now found ourselves another secure location, and I’m pleased to tell you that two of our regular contributors have joined me here this evening. Evening, boys! But before we hear from Royal and Romulus, let’s take a moment to report those deaths that the Wizarding Wireless Network News and Daily Prophet don’t think important enough to mention. It is with great regret that we inform our listeners of the murders of Ted Tonks and Dirk Cresswell. A goblin by the name of Gornuk was also killed. It is believed that Muggle-born Dean Thomas and a second goblin, both believed to have been traveling with Tonks, Cresswell, and Gornuk, may have escaped. If Dean is listening, or if anyone has any knowledge of his whereabouts, his parents and sisters are desperate for news. Meanwhile, in Gaddley, a Muggle family of five has been found dead in their home. Finally, we regret to inform our listeners that the remains of Bathilda Bagshot have been discovered in Godric’s Hollow. The evidence is that she died several months ago. The Order of the Phoenix informs us that her body showed unmistakable signs of injuries inflicted by Dark Magic. Thank you, And now we turn to regular contributor Royal, for an update on how the new Wizarding order is affecting the Muggle world. And what would you say, Royal, to those listeners who reply that in these dangerous times, it should be ‘Wizards first’? Excellently put, Royal, and you’ve got my vote for Minister of Magic if ever we get out of this mess, And now, over to Romulus for our popular feature  ‘Pals of Potter. Romulus, do you maintain, as you have every time you’ve appeared on our program, that Harry Potter is still alive? Sorry? . . . and our usual update on those friends of Harry Potter’s who are suffering for their allegiance? I suppose it helps, when escaping from Death Eaters, if you’ve got a sixteen-foot-high half brother? Indeed they are, Romulus, so we suggest that you continue to show your devotion to the man with the lightning scar by listening to Potterwatch! And now let’s move to news concerning the wizard who is proving just as elusive as Harry Potter.We like to refer to him as the Chief Death Eater and here to give his views on some of the more insane rumors circulating about him, I’d like to introduce a new correspondent: Rodent. Oh, all right then. ‘Rapier,’ could you please give us your take on the various stories we’ve been hearing about the Chief Death Eater? And the rumors that he keeps being sighted abroad? Thank you very much for those wise words, Rapier, Listeners, that brings us to the end of another Potterwatch. We don’t know when it will be possible to broadcast again, but you can be sure we shall be back. Keep twiddling those dials: The next password will be ‘Mad-Eye. ’ Keep each other safe: Keep faith. Good night.",

I know that you have learned the names of the planets and their moons in Astronomy, and that you have mapped the stars’ progress through the heavens.

It may take ten years to be sure of what we are seeing. In the past decade, the indications have been that Wizard-kind is living through nothing more than a brief calm between two wars. Mars, bringer of battle, shines brightly above us, suggesting that the fight must break out again soon. How soon, centaurs may attempt to divine by the burning of certain herbs and leaves, by the observation of fume and flame . . . Harry Potter, a word, please. You may stay, But close the door, please.

No — Wait — You carry him, He will be nice and visible in your arms, will he not? Pick up your little friend, Hagrid. And the glasses — put on the glasses — he must be recognizable — Move, Stop. He was killed as he ran away, trying to save himself while you lay down your lives for him. We bring you his body as proof that your hero is gone. Now, You have lost half of your fighters. My Death Eaters outnumber you, and the Boy Who Lived is finished. There must be no more war. Anyone who continues to resist, man, woman, or child, will be slaughtered, as will every member of their family. Come out of the castle now, kneel before me, and you shall be spared. Your parents and children, your brothers and sisters will live and be forgiven, and you will join me in the new world we shall build together. Come, Stop. Potter doesn’t mean that, That isn’t how he works, is it? Who are you going to use as a shield today, Potter? You, You think it will be you, do you, the boy who has survived by accident, and because Dumbledore was pulling the strings? Accidents! Accident and chance and the fact that you crouched and sniveled behind the skirts of greater men and women, and permitted me to kill them for you! But you did not! You dare — Is it love again? Dumbledore’s favorite solution, love, which he claimed conquered death, though love did not stop him falling from the tower and breaking like an old waxwork? Love, which did not prevent me stamping out your Mudblood mother like a cockroach, Potter — and nobody seems to love you enough to run forward this time and take my curse. So what will stop you dying now when I strike? If it is not love that will save you this time, you must believe that you have magic that I do not, or else a weapon more powerful than mine? You think you know more magic than I do? You mean he was weak! Too weak to dare, too weak to take what might have been his, what will be mine! I brought about the death of Albus Dumbledore! Dumbledore is dead! His body decays in the marble tomb in the grounds of this castle, I have seen it, Potter, and he will not return! What childish dream is this? He desired her, that was all, but when she had gone, he agreed that there were other women, and of purer blood, worthier of him — It matters not! It matters not whether Snape was mine or Dumbledore’s, or what petty obstacles they tried to put in my path! I crushed them as I crushed your mother, Snape’s supposed great love! Oh, but it all makes sense, Potter, and in ways that you do not understand! Now, He intended that Snape should be the true master of the wand! But I got there ahead of you, little boy — I reached the wand before you could get your hands on it, I understood the truth before you caught up. What is this? You dare — He killed — But then, Potter, Dumbledore as good as gave me the wand! I stole the wand from its last master’s tomb! I removed it against its last master’s wishes! Its power is mine!

Winky, ‘Why doesn’t Dobby and Winky find work together? ‘Where is there enough work for two house-elves? And Dobby thinks, and it comes to him, sir! Hogwarts!

Dobby has your owl, sir! Dobby volunteered to return Harry Potter’s owl! Professor Grubbly-Plank says she is all well now, sir! No, Dobby has been taking some for Winky too, sir. No, She still does not care for clothes, Harry Potter. Nor do the other house-elves.

Dobby does it all himself, sir, but Dobby does not mind, sir, for he always hopes to meet Harry Potter and tonight, sir, he has got his wish! But Harry Potter does not seem happy, Dobby heard him muttering in his sleep. Was Harry Potter having bad dreams? Dobby wishes he could help Harry Potter, for Harry Potter set Dobby free and Dobby is much, much happier now . . . Harry Potter, sir! Dobby knows the perfect place, sir! Dobby heard tell of it from the other house-elves when he came to Hogwarts, sir. It is known by us as the Come and Go Room, sir, or else as the Room of Requirement! Because it is a room that a person can only enter,when they have real need of it.  Sometimes it is there, and sometimes it is not, but when it appears, it is always equipped for the seeker’s needs. Dobby has used it, sir, when Winky has been very drunk. He has hidden her in the Room of Requirement and he has found antidotes to butterbeer there, and a nice elf-sized bed to settle her on while she sleeps it off, sir. . . . And Dobby knows Mr. Filch has found extra cleaning materials there when he has run short, sir, and — Dobby expects so, sir, It is a most amazing room, sir. Very few, sir. Mostly people stumbles across it when they needs it, sir, but often they never finds it again, for they do not know that it is always there waiting to be called into service, sir. Anytime, Harry Potter, sir, We could go now, if you like! Harry Potter, sir . . . Harry Potter, sir . . . Dobby has come to warn you . . . but the house-elves have been warned not to tell . . .

Ah well, guests first! After you, Harry dear! Not now, Arthur, Floo powder’s a lot quicker, dear, but goodness me, if you’ve never used it before — You must speak clearly, dear, And be sure to get out at the right grate. . . . Well, there are an awful lot of wizard fires to choose from, you know, but as long as you’ve spoken clearly — And your eyes shut, But don’t panic and get out too early; wait until you see Fred and George. You be careful, Arthur, That family’s trouble. Don’t go biting off more than you can chew — “— LETTER FROM DUMBLEDORE LAST NIGHT, I THOUGHT YOUR FATHER WOULD DIE OF SHAME, WE DIDN’T BRING YOU UP TO BEHAVE LIKE THIS, YOU AND HARRY COULD BOTH HAVE DIED —” “— ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED — YOUR FATHER’S FACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK, IT’S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT AND IF YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE WE’LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT BACK HOME.” W-what’s that I said, that’s enough,  Okay, “Second Head Boy in the family!” I don’t doubt that, I notice they haven’t made you two prefects. You want to set a better example for your sister! Do take care, won’t you, Harry? I’ve made you all sandwiches. . . . Here you are, Ron . . . no, they’re not corned beef. Where’s Fred? Here you are, dear. . . . Arthur! Arthur, what are you doing? It’s about to go! Arthur! Tell me what? What is this? Tell me what, Arthur? What is this? What have they done this time? You stay where you are! Yeah, I wrote to him yesterday. He might write back while I’m here. Look at the time, You really should be in bed, the whole lot of you — you’ll be up at the crack of dawn to get to the Cup. Harry, if you leave your school list out, I’ll get your things for you tomorrow in Diagon Alley. I’m getting everyone else’s. There might not be time after the World Cup, the match went on for five days last time. Well, they’re Apparating, aren’t they? So they can have a bit of a lie-in. Because you’re not of age and you haven’t passed your test, And where have those girls got to? Yes, well, he passed the second time, George! What is that in your pocket? Don’t you lie to me! Accio! Accio! Accio! We told you to destroy them! We told you to get rid of the lot! Accio! Accio! Accio! Oh a fine way to spend six months! No wonder you didn’t get more O. W.L.s! Well, have a lovely time, and behave yourselves, I’ll send Bill, Charlie, and Percy along around midday, Arthur, you’re supposed to be on holiday! This hasn’t got anything to do with your office; surely they can handle this without you? Hedwig, dear? No . . . no, there hasn’t been any post at all. Here you are, Now, mind you pack them properly so they don’t crease. Of course I haven’t, That’s for you. Dress robes. Dress robes! It says on your school list that you’re supposed to have dress robes this year . . . robes for formal occasions. Everyone wears them, Ron! They’re all like that! Your father’s got some for smart parties! Don’t be so silly, You’ve got to have dress robes, they’re on your list! I got some for Harry too . . . show him, Harry. . . . I thought they’d bring out the color of your eyes, dear, Because . . . well, I had to get yours secondhand, and there wasn’t a lot of choice! Fine, Goodness knows I could do with a laugh. He says someone tried to break into his house last night, Your father thinks very highly of Mad-Eye Moody, Oh it was my pleasure, dears, I’d invite you for Christmas, but . . . well, I expect you’re all going to want to stay at Hogwarts, what with . . . one thing and another. You’ll find out this evening, I expect, It’s going to be very exciting — mind you, I’m very glad they’ve changed the rules — I’m sure Professor Dumbledore will tell you. . . . Now, behave, won’t you? Won’t you, Fred? And you, George? Surprise! Thought we’d come and watch you, Harry! Hmm, I would have thought you’d know that, working at the Ministry! He’s very upset, The Ministry wants to keep Mr. Crouch’s disappearance quiet, but Percy’s been hauled in for questioning about the instructions Mr. Crouch has been sending in. They seem to think there’s a chance they weren’t genuinely written by him. Percy’s been under a lot of strain. Come to watch Harry in the last task! I must say, it makes a lovely change, not having to cook. How was your exam? they’re all called stuff like Bodrod the Bearded and Urg the Unclean; it wasn’t hard. Hello, Hermione, Oh! No — of course I didn’t! Sirius Black! You’ve got to take the rest of your potion, Harry, You have a good long sleep. Try and think about something else for a while . . . think about what you’re going to buy with your winnings! It wasn’t your fault, Harry, Oh, Harry, it’s lovely to see you! You’re looking peaky; you need feeding up, but you’ll have to wait a bit for dinner, I’m afraid . . . He’s just arrived, the meeting’s started . . . No, Harry, the meeting’s only for members of the Order. Ron and Hermione are upstairs, you can wait with them until the meeting’s over and then we’ll have dinner. And keep your voice down in the hall, I don’t want to wake anything up. I’ll explain later, I’ve got to hurry, I’m supposed to be at the meeting — I’ll just show you where you’re sleeping. Ron and Hermione will explain everything, dear, I’ve really got to dash, you’re the door on the right. I’ll call you when it’s over. The meeting’s over, you can come down and have dinner now, everyone’s dying to see you, Harry. And who’s left all those Dungbombs outside the kitchen door? Oh, Ginny, your hands are filthy, what have you been doing? Go and wash them before dinner, please . . . Here, dear, This sort of thing ought to be cleared away promptly at the end of meetings, And if you want dinner before midnight I’ll need a hand, Er — no, it’s all right, Tonks, you have a rest too, you’ve done enough today — Fred — George — NO, JUST CARRY THEM! FOR HEAVEN’S SAKE! THERE WAS NO NEED — I’VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS — JUST BECAUSE YOU’RE ALLOWED TO USE MAGIC NOW YOU DON’T HAVE TO WHIP YOUR WANDS OUT FOR EVERY TINY LITTLE THING! — none of your brothers caused this sort of trouble! Bill didn’t feel the need to Apparate every few feet! Charlie didn’t Charm everything he met! Percy — Sirius? Of course, it could just be a boggart, but I thought we ought to ask Alastor to have a look at it before we let it out. I thought we might try and tackle them tomorrow. I don’t think we need to hear any more of your business dealings, thank you very much, Mundungus, I don’t know where you learned about right and wrong, Mundungus, but you seem to have missed a few crucial lessons, Nearly time for bed, I think, It’s not down to you to decide what’s good for Harry! You haven’t forgotten what Dumbledore said, I suppose? The bit about not telling Harry more than he needs to know, No one’s denying what he’s done! He’s not an adult either! He’s not James, Sirius! I’m not sure you are! Sometimes, the way you talk about him, it’s as though you think you’ve got your best friend back! What’s wrong, Harry, is that you are not your father, however much you might look like him! You are still at school and adults responsible for you should not forget it! Sirius? Dumbledore knows the position has changed, Molly. He accepts that Harry will have to be filled in to a certain extent now that he is staying at headquarters — Yes, but there’s a difference between that and inviting him to ask whatever he likes! Well, well . . . I can see I’m going to be overruled. I’ll just say this: Dumbledore must have had his reasons for not wanting Harry to know too much, and speaking as someone who has got Harry’s best interests at heart — He’s as good as, Who else has he got? Yes, The thing is, it’s been rather difficult for you to look after him while you’ve been locked up in Azkaban, hasn’t it? Very well, Ginny — Ron — Hermione — Fred — George — I want you out of this kitchen, now. NO! They’re still at school — all right then Fine! Fine! Ginny — BED! I want you all to go straight to bed, no talking, We’ve got a busy day tomorrow. I expect Ginny’s asleep, so try not to wake her up. All right, Ron, Harry, Off to bed with you. Cover your faces and take a spray, It’s Doxycide. I’ve never seen an infestation this bad — what that house-elf’s been doing for the last ten years — Right you are, Sirius, Close the door, please, Harry, Right, you lot, you need to be careful, because doxies bite and their teeth are poisonous. I’ve got a bottle of antidote here, but I’d rather nobody needed it. When I say the word, start spraying immediately, They’ll come flying out at us, I expect, but it says on the sprays one good squirt will paralyze them. When they’re immobilized, just throw them in this bucket. “All right — squirt!” Fred, what are you doing? Spray that at once and throw it away! I think we’ll tackle those after lunch. WE ARE NOT RUNNING A HIDEOUT FOR STOLEN GOODS! — COMPLETELY IRRESPONSIBLE, AS IF WE HAVEN’T GOT ENOUGH TO WORRY ABOUT WITHOUT YOU DRAGGING STOLEN CAULDRONS INTO THE HOUSE — Lunch, Hurry up, you two, or there won’t be any food left, I’ve ironed your best clothes for tomorrow morning, Harry, and I want you to wash your hair tonight too. A good first impression can work wonders.” Arthur’s taking you to work with him, “Professor Dumbledore doesn’t think it’s a good idea for Sirius to go with you, and I must say I —” Breakfast, What do you want, Harry? Porridge? Muffins? Kippers? Bacon and eggs? Toast? I think we’ll go now, We’re a bit early, but I think you’ll be better off there than hanging around here. We’ve all got our fingers crossed, That’s enough — Fred — George — Ginny! Harry dear, come and sit down, have some lunch, you hardly ate breakfast . . . I don’t think he’ll be able to, Ron, He’s really very busy at the moment. SHUT UP! Still not finished? You were so keen to help the Order, you can do your bit by making headquarters fit to live in. Ginny said the booklists had come at last, If you give them to me I’ll take them over to Diagon Alley this afternoon and get your books while you’re packing. Ron, I’ll have to get you more pajamas, these are at least six inches too short, I can’t believe how fast you’re growing . . . what color would you like? What? His . . . but . . . Ron, you’re not . . . ? I don’t believe it! I don’t believe it! Oh, Ron, how wonderful! A prefect! That’s everyone in the family! Wait until your father hears! Ron, I’m so proud of you, what wonderful news, you could end up Head Boy just like Bill and Percy, it’s the first step! Oh, what a thing to happen in the middle of all this worry, I’m just thrilled, oh Ronnie — Well, what will it be? We gave Percy an owl, but you’ve already got one, of course. You’ve got to have a reward for this! How about a nice new set of dress robes? Or a new cauldron, Charlie’s old one’s rusting through, or a new rat, you always liked Scabbers — A prefect! I’ll see you all later. . . . Little Ronnie, a prefect! And don’t forget to pack your trunks. . . . A prefect . . . Oh, I’m all of a dither! Harry? Well, I think I’ll sort out that boggart before I turn in. . . . Arthur, I don’t want this lot up too late, all right? ’Night, Harry, dear. “R-r-riddikulus!’’ RIDDIKULUS! “R-riddikulus! RIDDIKULUS! No! No . . . riddikulus! Riddikulus! RIDDIKULUS! Oh — oh — oh! I see them d-d-dead all the time! All the t-t-time! I d-d-dream about it . . . D-d-don’t tell Arthur, I d-d-don’t want him to know. . . . Being silly . . . Not even able to get rid of a boggart . . . I’m just s-s-so worried, Half the f-f-family’s in the Order, it’ll b-b-be a miracle if we all come through this. . . . and P-P-Percy’s not talking to us. . . . What if something d-d-dreadful happens and we had never m-m-made up? And what’s going to happen if Arthur and I get killed, who’s g-g-going to look after Ron and Ginny? Being silly, — COULD HAVE DONE HER A SERIOUS INJURY, YOU IDIOTS — WILL YOU LOT GET DOWN HERE NOW, PLEASE! Harry, you’re to come with me and Tonks, Oh honestly . . . well, on your own head be it! She’s waiting for us just up here, I know, I know, but Mad-Eye wanted to wait for Sturgis. . . . If only Arthur could have got us cars from the Ministry again . . . but Fudge wouldn’t let him borrow so much as an empty ink bottle these days. . . . How Muggles can stand traveling without magic . . . I hope the others make it in time, Oh good, here’s Alastor with the luggage, look . . . Quick, quick, Write . . . Be good. . . . If you’ve forgotten anything we’ll send it on. . . . Onto the train, now, hurry . . . For heaven’s sake act more like a dog, Sirius! Over here! Hello, My husband, Arthur Weasley, was supposed to be moved to a different ward this morning, could you tell us — ? Thank you, Come on, you lot. Everything all right, Arthur? No, why? Arthur, you’ve had your bandages changed. Why have you had your bandages changed a day early, Arthur? They told me they wouldn’t need doing until tomorrow. Do you mean to tell me, that you have been messing about with Muggle remedies? Meaning? Yes, but even you, Arthur, wouldn’t be that stupid — What? What’s this? Harry dear, could you come down to the kitchen? Professor Snape would like a word with you. Professor Snape, dear. In the kitchen. He’d like a word. Professor Snape, dear, Now come on, quickly, he says he can’t stay long. Good-bye, Harry, take care, Oh, Oh, and Harry dear — how are you? Who’s there? Declare yourself! Harry, dear! Gracious, Albus, you gave me a fright, you said not to expect you before morning! Dear, why not come to dinner at the weekend, Remus and Mad-Eye are coming — ? You are sweet, Yes, Rufus Scrimgeour has set up several new offices in response to the present situation, and Arthur’s heading the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects. It’s a big job, he’s got ten people reporting to him now! Well, you see, in all the panic about You-Know-Who, odd things have been cropping up for sale everywhere, things that are supposed to guard against You-Know-Who and the Death Eaters. The other day Arthur confiscated a box of cursed Sneakoscopes that were almost certainly planted by a Death Eater. So you see, it’s a very important job, and I tell him it’s just silly to miss dealing with spark plugs and toasters and all the rest of that Muggle rubbish. Yes, he is. As a matter of fact, he’s a tiny bit late. . . . He said he’d be back around midnight. . . . It’s been like that for a while now, ever since You-Know-Who came back into the open. I suppose everybody’s in mortal danger now. . . . I don’t think it can be just our family . . . but I don’t know anyone else who’s got a clock like this, so I can’t check. Oh! He’s coming! Arthur, is that you? Oh, honestly . . . All right, all right . . . What is your dearest ambition? Arthur, really, this is just silly. . . . Mollywobbles, Yes, I mean, a Death Eater might have forced the answer out of you before impersonating you! And what really happens when you put them on? So is that why you’re late, Metamorph-Medals? Bed, I’ve got Fred and George’s room all ready for you, you’ll have it to yourself. Oh, they’re in Diagon Alley, sleeping in the little flat over their joke shop as they’re so busy, I must say, I didn’t approve at first, but they do seem to have a bit of a flair for business! Come on, dear, your trunk’s already up there. There was no need to bring up the tray, I was just about to do it myself! We hadn’t got around to telling him yet. tchah! I do not hate her! I just think they’ve hurried into this engagement, that’s all! Well, that’s not very long! I know why it’s happened, of course. It’s all this uncertainty with You-Know-Who coming back, people think they might be dead tomorrow, so they’re rushing all sorts of decisions they’d normally take time over. It was the same last time he was powerful, people eloping left, right, and center — Yes, well, your father and I were made for each other, what was the point in waiting? Whereas Bill and Fleur . . . well . . . what have they really got in common? He’s a hardworking, down-to-earth sort of person, whereas she’s — Stop calling her that, Ginny, Well, I’d better get on. . . . Eat your eggs while they’re warm, Harry. Ginny, come downstairs and help me with the lunch. Now! You won’t, dear, we’ll find an antidote, don’t worry, Yes, dear, I’d have noticed, But it’s barely nine, there’s still plenty of time. . . . Well done! Seven O.W.L. s, that’s more than Fred and George got together! Ah, Harry! Good, I wanted to explain about the security arrangements for the journey to Hogwarts tomorrow. We’ve got Ministry cars again, and there will be Aurors waiting at the station — No, I don’t think so, she’s been stationed somewhere else from what Arthur said. Yes, thank you, Quick, quick, through the barrier, Harry had better go first, with — You’d better get straight on the train, all of you, you’ve only got a few minutes to go, Well, have a lovely term, Ron. . . . Ron! Don’t you ever let me see you throwing knives again! Fred, George, I’m sorry, dears, but Remus is arriving tonight, so Bill will have to squeeze in with you two. — everyone should be comfortable. Well, they’ll have a bed, anyway, No, he’s busy, I expect, at the Ministry. Fred and George gave them to me! Aren’t they beautiful? I invited dear Tonks to come along today, But she wouldn’t come. Have you spoken to her lately, Remus? Hmmm, Arthur! Arthur — it’s Percy! Oh. Oh. Promise me you’ll look after yourself. . . . Stay out of trouble. . . . “Be good, then, all of you. . . .” Dumbledore’s told us how you saved him with the bezoar, Oh, Harry, what can we say?  You saved Ginny .. . you saved Arthur . . . now you’ve saved Ron . . . Bill, Oh, Bill! Of course, it doesn’t matter how he looks. . . . It’s not r-really important . . . but he was a very handsome little b-boy . . . always very handsome . . . and he was g-going to be married! “Well — only that —” No, that’s not what I — Well, yes, I’m sure, Bill, has a very beautiful tiara — goblin-made — which I am sure I could persuade her to lend you for the wedding.She is very fond of Bill, you know and it would look lovely with your hair. I’ve said all along you’re taking a ridiculous line on this, Remus, But she wants you, And after all, Remus, young and whole men do not necessarily remain so. Harry? You are the real Harry? What happened? Where are the others? Thank goodness you’re all right, I can’t make it grow back, not when it’s been removed by Dark Magic. But it could have been so much worse. Arthur! Oh thank goodness! How do you feel, Georgie? They’re not back yet, George, Can’t it — ? Don’t be silly, Harry, What are you talking about? But don’t be so silly! The whole point of tonight was to get you here safely, and thank goodness it worked. And Fleur’s agreed to get married here rather than in France, we’ve arranged everything so that we can all stay together and look after you — But why should he? Harry? We can put her up with Pigwidgeon and give her something to eat. Ron and Hermione seem to think that the three of you are dropping out of Hogwarts, May I ask why you are abandoning your education? What sort of ‘stuff’? Well, frankly, I think Arthur and I have a right to know, and I’m sure Mr. and Mrs. Granger would agree! I don’t see that you have to go either! You’re barely of age, any of you! It’s utter nonsense, if Dumbledore needed work doing, he had the whole Order at his command! Harry, you must have misunderstood him. Probably he was telling you something he wanted done, and you took it to mean that he wanted you — Oh, of course not, I should have realized. Well, Harry, while we’ve still got you here, you won’t mind helping with the preparations for Bill and Fleur’s wedding, will you? There’s still so much to do. Sweet of you, I’m so sorry to break up this cozy little gathering, I’m sure you all need your rest . . . but there are wedding presents stacked in my room that need sorting out and I was under the impression that you had agreed to help. Oh, good, you’ve fed the chickens, We’d better shut them away again before the men arrive tomorrow . . . to put up the tent for the wedding, Millamant’s Magic Marquees . . . they’re very good, Bill’s escorting them. . . . You’d better stay inside while they’re here, Harry. I must say it does complicate organizing a wedding, having all these security spells around the place. Oh, I didn’t mean — well, your safety’s much more important! Actually, I’ve been wanting to ask you how you want to celebrate your birthday, Harry. Seventeen, after all, it’s an important day. . . . Oh, I’ll invite Remus and Tonks, shall I? And how about Hagrid? Yes, Out of the way, out of the way! Oh, it’s nothing, dear, I think, The Minister — but why — ? I don’t understand — — raised voices, He’s gone! Harry, dear, everyone’s awfully hungry, we didn’t like to start without you. . . . Shall I serve dinner now? You’re underage! I won’t permit it! The boys, yes, but you, you’ve got to go home! She’s sixteen! She’s not old enough! Ginny! Potter, I — that was very — very gallant of you — but don’t you realize — ?",

Patronus Potter, The Minister was just telling me about your lucky escape, Potter, Quite astonishing, the way you continue to wriggle out of very tight holes. . . . Snakelike, in fact . . . And Arthur Weasley too! What are you doing here, Arthur? Not here, surely? I thought you were up on the second floor. . . . Don’t you do something that involves sneaking Muggle artifacts home and bewitching them? I don’t think private matters between myself and the Minister are any concern of yours, Potter, Really, just because you are Dumbledore’s favorite boy, you must not expect the same indulgence from the rest of us. . . . Shall we go up to your office, then, Minister? Very good, Potter. Now turn around, nice and slowly, and give that to me. To me, Potter, To me, Always, Now, give me the prophecy, Potter. Oh, you don’t know Potter as I do, Bellatrix, He has a great weakness for heroics; the Dark Lord understands this about him. Now give me the prophecy, Potter. It’s time you learned the difference between life and dreams, Potter, Now give me the prophecy, or we start using wands. Hand over the prophecy and no one need get hurt, I TOLD YOU, NO! If you smash it — ! NO! DO NOT ATTACK! WE NEED THE PROPHECY! WAIT UNTIL WE’VE GOT THE PROPHECY! Do not play games with us, Potter, Dumbledore never told you that the reason you bear that scar was hidden in the bowels of the Department of Mysteries? Can this be? So, Well, this explains why you didn’t come earlier, Potter, the Dark Lord wondered why — — you didn’t come running when he showed you the place where it was hidden in your dreams. He thought natural curiosity would make you want to hear the exact wording . . . Why? Why? Because the only people who are permitted to retrieve a prophecy from the Department of Mysteries, Potter, are those about whom it was made, as the Dark Lord discovered when he attempted to use others to steal it for him. About both of you, Potter, about both of you . . . Haven’t you ever wondered why the Dark Lord tried to kill you as a baby? Potter, your race is run, Now hand me the prophecy like a good boy . . .

However —” “Half an inch of skin and sinew holding my neck on, Harry! Most people would think that’s good and beheaded, but oh, no, it’s not enough for Sir Properly Decapitated-Podmore.” “So — what’s bothering you? Anything I can do?” “Well, this Halloween will be my five hundredth deathday,” “I’m holding a party down in one of the roomier dungeons. Friends will be coming from all over the country. It would be such an honor if you would attend. Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger would be most welcome, too, of course — but I daresay you’d rather go to the school feast?” “Enjoying yourselves?” Good evening, Now, Ron, the Sorting’s much more important than food, You’re lucky there’s a feast at all tonight, you know, There was trouble in the kitchens earlier. Peeves, of course, The usual argument, you know. He wanted to attend the feast — well, it’s quite out of the question, you know what he’s like, utterly uncivilized, can’t see a plate of food without throwing it. We held a ghost’s council — the Fat Friar was all for giving him the chance — but most wisely, in my opinion, the Bloody Baron put his foot down. Oh the usual, Wreaked havoc and mayhem. Pots and pans everywhere. Place swimming in soup. Terrified the house-elves out of their wits — Certainly, The largest number in any dwelling in Britain, I believe. Over a hundred. Well, they hardly ever leave the kitchen by day, do they? They come out at night to do a bit of cleaning . . . see to the fires and so on. . . . I mean, you’re not supposed to see them, are you? That’s the mark of a good house-elf, isn’t it, that you don’t know it’s there? Sick leave and pensions? House-elves don’t want sick leave and pensions! Oh yes, Yes, I have heard the hat give several warnings before, always at times when it detects periods of great danger for the school. And always, of course, its advice is the same: Stand together, be strong from within. I beg your pardon? How can it know if the school’s in danger if it’s a hat? I have no idea, Of course, it lives in Dumbledore’s office, so I daresay it picks things up there. Well, now, you shouldn’t take that attitude, Peaceful cooperation, that’s the key. We ghosts, though we belong to separate Houses, maintain links of friendship. In spite of the competitiveness between Gryffindor and Slytherin, I would never dream of seeking an argument with the Bloody Baron. Terrified? I hope I, Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, have never been guilty of cowardice in my life! The noble blood that runs in my veins — It’s a figure of speech! I assume I am still allowed to enjoy the use of whichever words I like, even if the pleasures of eating and drinking are denied me! But I am quite used to students poking fun at my death, I assure you! I would not go that way if I were you, Peeves is planning an amusing joke on the next person to pass the bust of Paracelsus halfway down the corridor. Harry  Subtlety has never been Peeves’s strong point.   I’m off to try and find the Bloody Baron. . . . He might be able to put a stop to it. . . . See you, Harry . . . Good evening, I am not the only one who is late, then?   Though, in rather different senses, of course . . Er — now, Harry? Can’t it wait until after the feast? Oh very well, I can’t pretend I haven’t been expecting it. You to come and find me, It happens, sometimes . . . when somebody has suffered a . . . loss. Yes, I walk and talk, yes. Not everyone can come back as a ghost. Only . . . only wizards. He won’t come back. Sirius Black, Wizards can leave an imprint of themselves upon the earth, to walk palely where their living selves once trod, But very few wizards choose that path. He won’t come back. He will have . . . gone on. I cannot answer, I was afraid of death, I chose to remain behind. I sometimes wonder whether I oughtn’t to have . . . Well, that is neither here nor there. . . . In fact, I am neither here nor there . I know nothing of the secrets of death, Harry,  I believe learned wizards study the matter in the Department of Mysteries — I am sorry not to have been more help, Well . . . well, do excuse me . . . the feast, you know . . . There has been much talk on that very subject even amongst the ghosts, I am considered something of a Potter authority; it is widely known that we are friendly. I have assured the spirit community that I will not pester you for information, however. ‘Harry Potter knows that he can confide in me with complete confidence,’ I told them.‘I would rather die than betray his trust. / Once again, you show all the sensitivity of a blunt axe, He is here, Professor Dumbledore returned to the school an hour ago. I had it from the Bloody Baron, who saw him arrive, said Nick. He appeared, according to the Baron, to be in good spirits, though a little tired, of course. Well, Oh — in his office, I believe, from what the Baron said, that he had business to attend to before turning in — Harry! My dear boy! The Gray Lady, of course; but if it is ghostly services you require — ? Let’s see. . . . That’s her over there, Harry, the young woman with the long hair.",

Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before,  But why has he sent you? But that was years ago, Years and years ago. I remember it well. That’s why they made him leave the school. They believed that I was the monster that dwells in what they call the Chamber of Secrets. They thought that Hagrid had opened the Chamber and set me free. Men, Men, It would have been my instinct, but out of respect for Hagrid, I never harmed a human. The body of the girl who was killed was discovered in a bathroom.

The thing that lives in the castle, is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others. Well do I remember how I pleaded with Hagrid to let me go, when I sensed the beast moving about the school. My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid, on my command.

He’s a danger to anyone who crosses him, magic or Muggle. I have the Prime Minister’s assurance that he will not breathe a word of Black’s true identity to anyone. And let’s face it — who’d believe him if he did?” There you are, Harry, Neville? This is Harry Potter. Yes, well, I’m very glad the Knight Bus picked Harry up, but he and I need to step inside the Leaky Cauldron now . . . Perhaps a pot of tea, And a private parlor, please, Tom, Sit down, Harry, I am Cornelius Fudge, Harry. The Minister of Magic. Well, Harry, you’ve had us all in a right flap, I don’t mind telling you. Running away from your aunt and uncle’s house like that! I’d started to think . . . but you’re safe, and that’s what matters. Eat, Harry, you look dead on your feet. Now then . . . You will be pleased to hear that we have dealt with the unfortunate blowing-up of Miss Marjorie Dursley. Two members of the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad were dispatched to Privet Drive a few hours ago. Miss Dursley has been punctured and her memory has been modified. She has no recollection of the incident at all. So that’s that, and no harm done. Ah, you’re worrying about the reaction of your aunt and uncle? Well, I won’t deny that they are extremely angry, Harry, but they are prepared to take you back next summer as long as you stay at Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays. Now, now, I’m sure you’ll feel differently once you’ve calmed down, They are your family, after all, and I’m sure you are fond of each other — er — very deep down. So all that remains, is to decide where you’re going to spend the last three weeks of your vacation. I suggest you take a room here at the Leaky Cauldron and — Punishment? Oh, my dear boy, we’re not going to punish you for a little thing like that! It was an accident! We don’t send people to Azkaban just for blowing up their aunts! Circumstances change, Harry. . . . We have to take into account . . . in the present climate . . . Surely you don’t want to be expelled? Righto, Now, have a crumpet, Harry, while I go and see if Tom’s got a room for you. Room eleven’s free, Harry, I think you’ll be very comfortable. Just one thing, and I’m sure you’ll understand . . . I don’t want you wandering off into Muggle London, all right? Keep to Diagon Alley. And you’re to be back here before dark each night. Sure you’ll understand. Tom will be keeping an eye on you for me. Don’t want to lose you again, do we? No, no . . . best we know where you are. . . . I mean . . . Okay, Have you had any luck with Black yet?  Okay, Oh, you’ve heard — well, no, not yet, but it’s only a matter of time. The Azkaban guards have never yet failed . . . and they are angrier than I’ve ever seen them. ’Bye then! Certainly, Ah, No, no, I’m very sorry, Harry, but as I’m not your parent or guardian — Okay, Perhaps you’ll be able to visit Hogsmeade next year. In fact, I think it’s best if you don’t . . . yes . . . well, I’ll be off. Enjoy your stay Harry. Hello there, Harry! Just had an exam, I expect? Nearly finished? Lovely day, Pity . . . pity . . . I’m here on an unpleasant mission, Harry. The Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures required a witness to the execution of a mad hippogriff. As I needed to visit Hogwarts to check on the Black situation, I was asked to step in.

Harry Potter, you know . . . we’ve all got a bit of a blind spot where he’s concerned. Well, well . . . we shall see, Snape, we shall see. . . . The boy has undoubtedly been foolish. . . . What amazes me most is the behavior of the dementors . . . you’ve really no idea what made them retreat, Snape? Harry, Harry, what’s this? You should be in bed — has he had any chocolate? we’ve got everything under control. . . .” the young lady is disturbed in her mind, we must make allowances — The dementors should have arrived by now, I’ll go and meet them. Dumbledore, I’ll see you upstairs. See here, Snape, be reasonable, This door’s been locked, we just saw — Calm down, man! You’re talking nonsense! Fellow seems quite unbalanced, I’d watch out for him if I were you, Dumbledore. He’s not the only one! The Daily Prophet’s going to have a field day! We had Black cornered and he slipped through our fingers yet again! All it needs now is for the story of that hippogriff’s escape to get out, and I’ll be a laughingstock! Well . . . I’d better go and notify the Ministry. . . . Oh yes, they’ll have to go, Never dreamed they’d attempt to administer the Kiss on an innocent boy. . . . Completely out of control . . . no, I’ll have them packed off back to Azkaban tonight. . . . Perhaps we should think about dragons at the school entrance. . . . Knew we’d get there in the end, Ah, I see his house-elf’s saving him a seat. . . . Good job too, these Bulgarian blighters have been trying to cadge all the best places . . . ah, and here’s Lucius! How do you do, how do you do? And allow me to introduce you to Mr. Oblansk — Obalonsk — Mr. — well, he’s the Bulgarian Minister of Magic, and he can’t understand a word I’m saying anyway, so never mind. Lucius has just given a very generous contribution to St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, Arthur. He’s here as my guest. Ready when you are, Ludo, Sonorus! You can speak English! And you’ve been letting me mime everything all day! Harry! How are you? Fine, We were just talking about the night when Mr. Crouch turned up on the grounds, It was you who found him, was it not? Yes, well, we’re about to go for a short walk on the grounds, Harry, if you’ll excuse us . . . perhaps if you just go back to your class — What’s going on? What’s happened? My God — Diggory! Dumbledore — he’s dead! Harry, let go of him, He’ll need to go to the hospital wing! He’s ill, he’s injured — Dumbledore, Diggory’s parents, they’re here,  they’re in the stands. I’ll take Harry, Dumbledore, I’ll take him — Where’s Dumbledore? My dear woman! as Minister of Magic, it is my decision whether I wish to bring protection with me when interviewing a possibly dangerous — By all accounts, he is no loss! It seems he has been responsible for several deaths! Why he killed them? Well, that’s no mystery, is it? He was a raving lunatic! From what Minerva and Severus have told me, he seems to have thought he was doing it all on You-Know-Who’s instructions! You-Know-Who . . . returned? Preposterous. Come now, Dumbledore . . . See here, Dumbledore, you — you can’t seriously believe that. You-Know-Who — back? Come now, come now .. . certainly, Crouch may have believed himself to be acting upon You-Know-Who’s orders — but to take the word of a lunatic like that, Dumbledore . . . You are — er — prepared to take Harry’s word on this, are you, Dumbledore? You are prepared to believe that Lord Voldemort has returned, on the word of a lunatic murderer, and a boy who . . . well . . . And if I have? If I have discovered that you’ve been keeping certain facts about the boy very quiet? A Parselmouth, eh? And having funny turns all over the place — You admit that he has been having these pains, then? Headaches? Nightmares? Possibly — hallucinations? You’ll forgive me, Dumbledore, but I’ve never heard of a curse scar acting as an alarm bell before. . . . Malfoy was cleared! Also cleared! Now working for the Ministry! You are merely repeating the names of those who were acquitted of being Death Eaters thirteen years ago! You could have found those names in old reports of the trials! For heaven’s sake, Dumbledore — the boy was full of some crackpot story at the end of last year too — his tales are getting taller, and you’re still swallowing them — the boy can talk to snakes, Dumbledore, and you still think he’s trustworthy? I see no evidence to the contrary! It seems to me that you are all determined to start a panic that will destabilize everything we have worked for these last thirteen years! Preposterous! Remove the dementors? I’d be kicked out of office for suggesting it! Half of us only feel safe in our beds at night because we know the dementors are standing guard at Azkaban! Envoys to the giants? What madness is this? You — you cannot be serious! If the magical community got wind that I had approached the giants — people hate them, Dumbledore — end of my career — Insane, Mad . . . Now, see here, Dumbledore, I’ve given you free rein, always. I’ve had a lot of respect for you. I might not have agreed with some of your decisions, but I’ve kept quiet. There aren’t many who’d have let you hire werewolves, or keep Hagrid, or decide what to teach your students without reference to the Ministry. But if you’re going to work against me — He can’t be back, Dumbledore, he just can’t be . . . I don’t know what you and your staff are playing at, Dumbledore, but I have heard enough. I have no more to add. I will be in touch with you tomorrow, Dumbledore, to discuss the running of this school. I must return to the Ministry. Your winnings, One thousand Galleons. There should have been a presentation ceremony, but under the circumstances . . . Very well, The accused being present — finally — let us begin. Are you ready? Disciplinary hearing of the twelfth of August, into offenses committed under the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery and the International Statute of Secrecy by Harry James Potter, resident at number four, Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey. Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge, Minister of Magic; Amelia Susan Bones, Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement; Percy Ignatius Weasley — Ah, Dumbledore. Yes — well — I suppose we’ll need another chair — I — Weasley, could you — ? Yes, Well, then. So. The charges. Yes. The charges against the accused are as follows: That he did knowingly, deliberately, and in full awareness of the illegality of his actions, having received a previous written warning from the Ministry of Magic on a similar charge, produce a Patronus Charm in a Muggle-inhabited area, in the presence of a Muggle, on August the second at twenty-three minutes past nine, which constitutes an offense under paragraph C of the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery, 1875, and also under section thirteen of the International Confederation of Wizards’ Statute of Secrecy. You are Harry James Potter, of number four, Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey? You received an official warning from the Ministry for using illegal magic three years ago, did you not? And yet you conjured a Patronus on the night of the second of August? Knowing that you are not permitted to use magic outside school while you are under the age of seventeen? Knowing that you were in an area full of Muggles? Fully aware that you were in close proximity to a Muggle at the time? It’s not a question of how impressive the magic was, In fact, the more impressive the worse it is, I would have thought, given that the boy did it in plain view of a Muggle! Ah, Yes. Yes, I thought we’d be hearing something like this. Ah, Let me explain. He’s been thinking it through and decided dementors would make a very nice little cover story, very nice indeed. Muggles can’t see dementors, can they, boy? Highly convenient, highly convenient . . . so it’s just your word and no witnesses . . . We haven’t got time to listen to more taradiddles, I’m afraid, Dumbledore. I want this dealt with quickly — Very well, Where is this person? No — Weasley, you go, Full name? And who exactly are you? A Squib, eh? Incidentally, can Squibs see dementors? Very well, What is your story? That’s what you saw, is it? Very well, You may go. Not a very convincing witness, But dementors wandering into a Muggle suburb and just happening to come across a wizard? The odds on that must be very, very long, even Bagman wouldn’t have bet — And what is that supposed to mean? I think we might have a record of it if someone had ordered a pair of dementors to go strolling through Little Whinging! Dumbledore. and I have no reason to believe that your views are anything other than bilge, Dumbledore. The dementors remain in place in Azkaban and are doing everything we ask them to. The Chair recognizes Dolores Jane Umbridge, Senior Undersecretary to the Minister, There are no dementors outside Ministry control! It is not for you to decide what the Ministry of Magic does or does not do, Dumbledore! I would remind everybody that the behavior of these dementors, if indeed they are not figments of this boy’s imagination, is not the subject of this hearing! We are here to examine Harry Potter’s offenses under the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery! We are familiar with clause seven, thank you very much! If there were dementors, which I doubt — It’s — I want this over with today, Dumbledore! Serious miscarriage, my hat! Have you ever bothered to tot up the number of cock-and-bull stories this boy has come out with, Dumbledore, while trying to cover up his flagrant misuse of magic out of school? I suppose you’ve forgotten the Hover Charm he used three years ago — YOU SEE? A house-elf! In a Muggle house! I ask you — I — not — I haven’t got time to listen to house-elves! Anyway, that’s not the only — he blew up his aunt, for God’s sake! And I haven’t even started on what he gets up to at school — Oho! Not our business what he does at school, eh? You think so? Laws can be changed, Very well, Certainly, This way, Lucius. We find ourselves, most unfortunately, in the same position we were two and a half years ago when the murderer Sirius Black escaped, Nor do we think the two breakouts are unrelated. An escape of this magnitude suggests outside help, and we must remember that Black, as the first person ever to break out of Azkaban, would be ideally placed to help others follow in his footsteps. We think it likely that these individuals, who include Black’s cousin, Bellatrix Lestrange, have rallied around Black as their leader. We are, however, doing all we can to round up the criminals and beg the magical community to remain alert and cautious. On no account should any of these individuals be approached. Well, Well, well, well . . . Did he, did he? I must remember to tell Lucius. Well, Potter . . . I expect you know why you are here? I beg your pardon? You don’t know why you are here? So you have no idea, why Professor Umbridge has brought you to this office? You are not aware that you have broken any school rules? Or Ministry decrees? So it’s news to you, is it, that an illegal student organization has been discovered within this school? Yes, yes, do, There’s nothing like a good witness, is there, Dumbledore? Jolly good, jolly good! Like mother, like daughter, eh? Well, come on, now, dear, look up, don’t be shy, let’s hear what you’ve got to — galloping gargoyles! Well, now, Now, will you tell me what happened at this meeting? What was its purpose? Who was there? Haven’t we got a counterjinx for this? So she can speak freely? Well, Yes, do let’s hear the latest cock-and-bull story designed to pull Potter out of trouble! Go on, then, Dumbledore, go on — Willy Widdershins was lying, was he? Or was it Potter’s identical twin in the Hog’s Head that day? Or is there the usual simple explanation involving a reversal of time, a dead man coming back to life, and a couple of invisible dementors? Dolores, Excellent, Excellent, Dolores. And . . . by thunder . . . See what they’ve named themselves? Dumbledore’s Army. Statement? What — I don’t — ? You? You organized this? You recruited these students for — for your army? Then you have been plotting against me! Yes, shut up, Potter! Well, well, well — I came here tonight expecting to expel Potter and instead — Weasley! Weasley, have you written it all down, everything he’s said, his confession, have you got it? The bit about how he’s been trying to build up an army against the Ministry, how he’s been working to destabilize me? Very well, then, Duplicate your notes, Weasley, and send a copy to the Daily Prophet at once. If we send a fast owl we should make the morning edition! You will now be escorted back to the Ministry, where you will be formally charged and then sent to Azkaban to await trial! Snag? I see no snag, Dumbledore! Oh really? So, you intend to take on Dawlish, Shacklebolt, Dolores, and myself single-handed, do you, Dumbledore? Enough of this rubbish! Dawlish! Shacklebolt! Take him! Where is he? Where is he? Well, Minerva, I’m afraid this is the end of your friend Dumbledore. “You’d better get those two off to bed,” I know, Williamson, I know, I saw him too! Merlin’s beard — here — here! — in the Ministry of Magic! — great heavens above — it doesn’t seem possible — my word — how can this be? Dumbledore! Seize him! Very well — Dawlish! Williamson! Go down to the Department of Mysteries and see . . . Dumbledore, you — you will need to tell me exactly — the Fountain of Magical Brethren — what happened? Harry — Harry Potter? He-here? Why — what’s all this about? Dumbledore! You haven’t got authorization for that Portkey! You can’t do things like that right in front of the Minister of Magic, you — you — “I — you —” It is with great regret that I must confirm that the wizard styling himself Lord — well, you know who I mean — is alive and among us again, It is with almost equal regret that we report the mass revolt of the dementors of Azkaban, who have shown themselves averse to continuing in the Ministry’s employ. We believe that the dementors are currently taking direction from Lord — Thingy. We urge the magical population to remain vigilant. The Ministry is currently publishing guides to elementary home and personal defense that will be delivered free to all Wizarding homes within the coming month.",

Sit, my children, sit, Welcome to Divination, My name is Professor Trelawney. You may not have seen me before. I find that descending too often into the hustle and bustle of the main school clouds my Inner Eye. So you have chosen to study Divination, the most difficult of all magical arts. I wouldn’t be so sure if I were you, dear,” My dear, In the second term, we shall progress to the crystal ball — if we have finished with fire omens, that is. Unfortunately, classes will be disrupted in February by a nasty bout of flu. I myself will lose my voice. And around Easter, one of our number will leave us forever. I wonder, dear, if you could pass me the largest silver teapot? Thank you, my dear. Incidentally, that thing you are dreading — it will happen on Friday the sixteenth of October. Now, I want you all to divide into pairs. Collect a teacup from the shelf, come to me, and I will fill it. Then sit down and drink, drink until only the dregs remain. You will interpret the patterns using pages five and six of Unfogging the Future. I shall move among you, helping and instructing. Oh, and dear after you’ve broken your first cup, would you be so kind as to select one of the blue-patterned ones? I’m rather attached to the pink. One of the blue ones, then, dear, if you wouldn’t mind . . . thank you. . . . Broaden your minds, my dears, and allow your eyes to see past the mundane! Right, you’ve got a crooked sort of cross . . . That means you’re going to have ‘trials and suffering’ — sorry about that — but there’s a thing that could be the sun . . . hang on . . . that means ‘great happiness’ . . . so you’re going to suffer but be very happy. . . . There’s a blob a bit like a bowler hat, Maybe you’re going to work for the Ministry of Magic. . . . But this way it looks more like an acorn. . . . What’s that? ‘A windfall, unexpected gold. ’ Excellent, you can lend me some . . . and there’s a thing here, that looks like an animal . . .  yeah, if that was its head . . . it looks like a hippo . . . no, a sheep . . . Let me see that, my dear, The falcon . . . my dear, you have a deadly enemy. an attack. Dear, dear, this is not a happy cup. . . . The skull . . . danger in your path, my dear. . . . My dear boy . . . my poor, dear boy . . . no . . . it is kinder not to say . . . no . . . don’t ask me. . . . My dear, you have the Grim. My dear, “The giant, spectral dog that haunts churchyards! My dear boy, it is an omen — the worst omen — of death!” I think we will leave the lesson here for today, Yes . . . please pack away your things. . . . Until we meet again, fair fortune be yours. Oh, and dear you’ll be late next time, so mind you work extra-hard to catch up. I have been crystal gazing, Headmaster, and to my astonishment, I saw myself abandoning my solitary luncheon and coming to join you. Who am I to refuse the promptings of fate? I at once hastened from my tower, and I do beg you to forgive my lateness. . . . I dare not, Headmaster! If I join the table, we shall be thirteen! Nothing could be more unlucky! Never forget that when thirteen dine together, the first to rise will be the first to die! But where is dear Professor Lupin? Certainly I knew, Minerva, But one does not parade the fact that one is All-Knowing. I frequently act as though I am not possessed of the Inner Eye, so as not to make others nervous. If you must know, Minerva, I have seen that poor Professor Lupin will not be with us for very long. He seems aware, himself, that his time is short. He positively fled when I offered to crystal gaze for him — My dears! Which of you left his seat first? Which? Good day to you! I have decided to introduce the crystal ball a little earlier than I had planned, The fates have informed me that your examination in June will concern the Orb, and I am anxious to give you sufficient practice. and Would anyone like me to help them interpret the shadowy portents within their Orb? Now, really! You are disturbing the clairvoyant vibrations! There is something here! Something moving . . . but what is it? My dear . . . , It is here, plainer than ever before . . . my dear, stalking toward you, growing ever closer . . . the Gr — My dear . . . , Indeed, I don’t remember ever meeting a student whose mind was so hopelessly mundane. My dear . . . , One hopes, however, that one might have mistaken the Signs. . . . The Inner Eye can be a burden, you know. . . . Ronald Weasley, Harry Potter! What does it resemble? Think, now . . . Indeed! My boy, you may well be seeing the outcome of poor Hagrid’s trouble with the Ministry of Magic! Look closer. . . . Does the hippogriff appear to . . . have its head? Are you sure? You don’t see it writhing on the ground, perhaps, and a shadowy figure raising an axe behind it? No blood? No weeping Hagrid? Well, dear, I think we’ll leave it there. . . . A little disappointing . . . but I’m sure you did your best. IT WILL HAPPEN TONIGHT. THE DARK LORD LIES ALONE AND FRIENDLESS, ABANDONED BY HIS FOLLOWERS. HIS SERVANT HAS BEEN CHAINED THESE TWELVE YEARS. TONIGHT, BEFORE MIDNIGHT . . . THE SERVANT WILL BREAK FREE AND SET OUT TO REJOIN HIS MASTER. THE DARK LORD WILL RISE AGAIN WITH HIS SERVANT’S AID, GREATER AND MORE TERRIBLE THAN EVER BEFORE TONIGHT . . . BEFORE MIDNIGHT . . . THE SERVANT . . . WILL SET OUT . . . TO REJOIN . I’m so sorry, dear boy, the heat of the day, you know . . . I drifted off for a moment. . . . Is there anything wrong, my dear? The Dark Lord? He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named? My dear boy, that’s hardly something to joke about. . . . Rise again, indeed — I think you must have dozed off too, dear! I would certainly not presume to predict anything quite as far-fetched as that! Good day, You are preoccupied, my dear, My inner eye sees past your brave face to the troubled soul within. And I regret to say that your worries are not baseless. I see difficult times ahead for you, alas . . . most difficult . . . I fear the thing you dread will indeed come to pass . . . and perhaps sooner than you think. . . . My dears, it is time for us to consider the stars, The movements of the planets and the mysterious portents they reveal only to those who understand the steps of the celestial dance. Human destiny may be deciphered by the planetary rays, which intermingle . . . . . I fear the thing you dread will indeed come to pass . . . I was saying, my dear, that you were clearly born under the baleful influence of Saturn, Saturn, dear, the planet Saturn! I was saying that Saturn was surely in a position of power in the heavens at the moment of your birth. . . . Your dark hair . . . your mean stature . . . tragic losses so young in life . . . I think I am right in saying, my dear, that you were born in midwinter? It is Uranus, my dear, A detailed analysis of the way the planetary movements in the coming month will affect you, with reference to your personal chart, I want it ready to hand in next Monday, and no excuses! Death, my dears. Yes, it comes, ever closer, it circles overhead like a vulture, ever lower . . . ever lower over the castle. . . . What? What was it, Potter? A premonition? An apparition? What did you see? You were clutching your scar! You were rolling on the floor, clutching your scar! Come now, Potter, I have experience in these matters! My dears, If you leave now, you may lose the opportunity to see further than you have ever — Good day, And welcome back to Divination. I have, of course, been following your fortunes most carefully over the holidays, and am delighted to see that you have all returned to Hogwarts safely — as, of course, I knew you would. You will find on the tables before you copies of The Dream Oracle, by Inigo Imago. Dream interpretation is a most important means of di-vining the future and one that may very probably be tested in your O.W.L.  Not, of course, that I believe examination passes or failures are of the remotest importance when it comes to the sacred art of divination. If you have the Seeing Eye, certificates and grades matter very little. However, the headmaster likes you to sit the examination, so . . . Turn, please, to the introduction and read what Imago has to say on the matter of dream interpretation. Then divide into pairs. Use The Dream Oracle to interpret each other’s most recent dreams. Carry on. We shall be continuing our study of prophetic dreams today, Divide into pairs, please, and interpret each other’s latest nighttime visions with the aid of the Oracle. Nearly sixteen years. Yep, Yes, These things often skip — er — three generations, I don’t understand you, The Inner Eye does not See upon command! I — but — but . . . wait! I . . . I think I do see something . . . something that concerns you. . . . Why, I sense something . . . something dark . . . some grave peril . . . I am afraid . . . I am afraid that you are in grave danger! Well? Let me see the start you’ve made on your dream diary, please. Well, carry on! You know what to do! Or am I such a substandard teacher that you have never learned how to open a book? Yes, Certainly not! I have been insulted, certainly. . . . Insinuations have been made against me. . . . Unfounded accusations levelled . . . but no, there is nothing wrong, certainly not . . . I say nothing, of sixteen years’ devoted service. . . . It has passed, apparently, unnoticed. . . . But I shall not be insulted, no, I shall not! The establishment! Yes, those with eyes too clouded by the Mundane to See as I See, to Know as I Know . . . Of course, we Seers have always been feared, always persecuted. . . . It is — alas — our fate . . . Do not speak to me about that woman! Kindly continue with your work! . . . may well choose to leave . . . the indignity of it . . . on probation . . . we shall see . . . how she dares . . . “The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord ap-proaches. … Born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies … and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not … and either must die at the hand of the other for nei-ther can live while the other survives. … The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies. …” Two of spades: conflict, Seven of spades: an ill omen. Ten of spades: a dark young man, possibly troubled, one who dislikes the questioner — Well, that can’t be right, Good evening, my dear, I haven’t seen you in my classes lately. . . . Oh, of course, Or Dobbin, as I prefer to think of him. You would have thought, would you not, that now I am returned to the school Professor Dumbledore might have got rid of the horse? But no . . . we share classes. . . . It’s an insult, frankly, an insult. Do you know . . . Harry Potter! My dear boy! The rumors! The stories! ‘The Chosen One’! Of course, I have known for a very long time. . . . The omens were never good, Harry. . . . But why have you not returned to Divination? For you, of all people, the subject is of the utmost importance! Aha! So this is the reason I am to be thrown unceremoniously from your office, Dumbledore! Very well, If you will not banish the usurping nag, so be it. . . . Perhaps I shall find a school where my talents are better appreciated. . . . How — dare — you — aaaaargh! You may well ask! I was strolling along, brooding upon certain dark portents I happen to have glimpsed . . . What? I — well — I didn’t know students knew about — I — Oh, I got in all right, But there was somebody already in there. I have no idea, I walked into the room and I heard a voice, which has never happened before in all my years of hiding — of using the room, I mean. I don’t know that it was saying anything, It was . . . whooping. Gleefully, I would hazard a guess at male, Very happy, Most definitely. And then I called out ‘Who’s there? ’ The Inner Eye, was fixed upon matters well outside the mundane realms of whooping voices. No, it did not, Everything went pitch-black and the next thing I knew, I was being hurled headfirst out of the room! No, I did not, as I say, it was pitch — Again and again, no matter how I lay them out —” “You think so?” Oh, well, I miss having you in my classes, Harry, You were never much of a Seer . . . but you were a wonderful Object . . . I am afraid, that the nag — I’m sorry, the centaur — knows nothing of cartomancy. I asked him — one Seer to another — had he not, too, sensed the distant vibrations of coming catastrophe? But he seemed to find me almost comical. Yes, comical! Perhaps the horse has heard people say that I have not inherited my great-great-grandmother’s gift. Those rumors have been bandied about by the jealous for years. You know what I say to such people, Harry? Would Dumbledore have let me teach at this great school, put so much trust in me all these years, had I not proved myself to him? I well remember my first interview with Dumbledore, He was deeply impressed, of course, deeply impressed. . . . I was staying at the Hog’s Head, which I do not advise, incidentally — bedbugs, dear boy — but funds were low. Dumbledore did me the courtesy of calling upon me in my room. He questioned me.. . . I must confess that, at first, I thought he seemed ill-disposed toward Divination . . . and I remember I was starting to feel a little odd, I had not eaten much that day . . . but then . . . . but then we were rudely interrupted by Severus Snape! Yes, there was a commotion outside the door and it flew open, and there was that rather uncouth barman standing with Snape, who was waffling about having come the wrong way up the stairs, although I’m afraid that I myself rather thought he had been apprehended eavesdropping on my interview with Dumbledore — you see, he himself was seeking a job at the time, and no doubt hoped to pick up tips! Well, after that, you know, Dumbledore seemed much more disposed to give me a job, and I could not help thinking, Harry, that it was because he appreciated the stark contrast between my own unassuming manners and quiet talent, compared to the pushing, thrusting young man who was prepared to listen at keyholes — Harry, dear? Harry? Harry? Harry — I thought we were going to see the headmaster together? Yeah,",

Now, then, Nothing to worry about,  “There’s a boggart in there.” Boggarts like dark, enclosed spaces, Wardrobes, the gap beneath beds, the cupboards under sinks — I once met one that had lodged itself in a grandfather clock. This one moved in yesterday afternoon, and I asked the headmaster if the staff would leave it to give my third years some practice. So, the first question we must ask ourselves is, what is a boggart? Couldn’t have put it better myself, So the boggart sitting in the darkness within has not yet assumed a form. He does not yet know what will frighten the person on the other side of the door. Nobody knows what a boggart looks like when he is alone, but when I let him out, he will immediately become whatever each of us most fears. This means, that we have a huge advantage over the boggart before we begin. Have you spotted it, Harry? Precisely, It’s always best to have company when you’re dealing with a boggart. He becomes confused. I once saw a boggart make that very mistake — tried to frighten two people at once and turned himself into half a slug. Not remotely frightening. The charm that repels a boggart is simple, yet it requires force of mind. You see, the thing that really finishes a boggart is laughter. What you need to do is force it to assume a shape that you find amusing. We will practice the charm without wands first. After me, please . . . Riddikulus! Good, You see, the word alone is not enough. And this is where you come in, Neville. What? What? First things first: What would you say is the thing that frightens you most in the world? Professor, No, no, you misunderstand me, I wonder, could you tell us what sort of clothes your grandmother usually wears? And a handbag? Good, Can you picture those clothes very clearly, Neville? Can you see them in your mind’s eye? . . Riddikulus! And you will raise your wand — thus — and cry ‘Riddikulus’ — and concentrate hard on your grandmother’s clothes. If all goes well, Professor Boggart Snape will be forced into that vulture-topped hat, and that green dress, with that big red handbag. If Neville is successful, the boggart is likely to shift his attention to each of us in turn, I would like all of you to take a moment now to think of the thing that scares you most, and imagine how you might force it to look comical. . . . Everyone ready?  Good, Let you have a clear field, all right? I’ll call the next person forward. . . . Everyone back, now, so Neville can get a clear shot — On the count of three, Neville, One — two — three — now! Parvati! Forward! Seamus! It’s confused! We’re getting there! Dean! Excellent! Ron, you next! Here! . . Riddikulus! Riddikulus! Forward, Neville, and finish him off! Excellent! Good, . . five points to Gryffindor for every person to tackle the boggart — ten for Neville because he did it twice . . . and five each to Hermione and Harry. Good, Very well, everyone, an excellent lesson. Homework, kindly read the chapter on boggarts and summarize it for me . . . to be handed in on Monday. That will be all. Water demon, We shouldn’t have much difficulty with him, not after the kappas. The trick is to break his grip. You notice the abnormally long fingers? Strong, but very brittle. Cup of tea? I was just thinking of making one. Sit down, I’ve only got teabags, I’m afraid — but I daresay you’ve had enough of tea leaves? Professor McGonagall told me, You’re not worried, are you? Harry? Yes, I would have thought that was obvious, Harry, Well, I assumed that if the boggart faced you, it would assume the shape of Lord Voldemort. Clearly, I was wrong, But I didn’t think it a good idea for Lord Voldemort to materialize in the staffroom. I imagined that people would panic. “That suggests that what you fear most of all is — fear. Very wise, Harry.” So you’ve been thinking that I didn’t believe you capable of fighting the boggart? Come in, Come in, Ah, Severus, Thanks very much. Could you leave it here on the desk for me? I was just showing Harry my grindylow, Yes, yes, I will, I should probably take some again tomorrow. Thanks very much, Severus. Professor Snape has very kindly concocted a potion for me, I have never been much of a potion-brewer and this one is particularly complex. Pity sugar makes it useless, I’ve been feeling a bit off-color, This potion is the only thing that helps. I am very lucky to be working alongside Professor Snape; there aren’t many wizards who are up to making it. Really? Did you tell Professor Snape we haven’t covered them yet? Don’t worry. I’ll speak to Professor Snape. You don’t have to do the essay. Lures travelers into bogs, You notice the lantern dangling from his hand? Hops ahead — people follow the light — then — Wait a moment, Harry, I’d like a word. I heard about the match, and I’m sorry about your broomstick. Is there any chance of fixing it? They planted the Whomping Willow the same year that I arrived at Hogwarts. In the end, a boy called Davey Gudgeon nearly lost an eye, and we were forbidden to go near it. No broomstick would have a chance. Yes, I did. I don’t think any of us have seen Professor Dumbledore that angry. They have been growing restless for some time . . . furious at his refusal to let them inside the grounds. . . . I suppose they were the reason you fell? It has nothing to do with weakness, The dementors affect you worse than the others because there are horrors in your past that the others don’t have. Dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth. They infest the darkest, filthiest places, they glory in decay and despair, they drain peace, hope, and happiness out of the air around them. Even Muggles feel their presence, though they can’t see them. Get too near a dementor and every good feeling, every happy memory will be sucked out of you. If it can, the dementor will feed on you long enough to reduce you to something like itself . . . soulless and evil. You’ll be left with nothing but the worst experiences of your life. And the worst that happened to you, Harry, is enough to make anyone fall off their broom. You have nothing to feel ashamed of. They’re getting hungry, Dumbledore won’t let them into the school, so their supply of human prey has dried up. . . . I don’t think they could resist the large crowd around the Quidditch field.  All that excitement . . . emotions running high . . . it was their idea of a feast. The fortress is set on a tiny island, way out to sea, but they don’t need walls and water to keep the prisoners in, not when they’re all trapped inside their own heads, incapable of a single cheerful thought. Most of them go mad within weeks. Yes, Black must have found a way to fight them. I wouldn’t have believed it possible. . . . Dementors are supposed to drain a wizard of his powers if he is left with them too long. . . . You made that dementor on the train back off, There are — certain defenses one can use, But there was only one dementor on the train. The more there are, the more difficult it becomes to resist. I don’t pretend to be an expert at fighting dementors, Harry . . . quite the contrary. . . . Well . . . all right. I’ll try and help. But it’ll have to wait until next term, I’m afraid. I have a lot to do before the holidays. I chose a very inconvenient time to fall ill. Ah, Let me see . . . how about eight o’clock on Thursday evening? The History of Magic classroom should be large enough. . . . I’ll have to think carefully about how we’re going to do this. . . . We can’t bring a real dementor into the castle to practice on. . . . Another boggart, I’ve been combing the castle ever since Tuesday, and very luckily, I found this one lurking inside Mr. Filch’s filing cabinet. It’s the nearest we’ll get to a real dementor. The boggart will turn into a dementor when he sees you, so we’ll be able to practice on him. I can store him in my office when we’re not using him; there’s a cupboard under my desk he’ll like. So . . . The spell I am going to try and teach you is highly advanced magic, Harry — well beyond Ordinary Wizarding Level. It is called the Patronus Charm. Well, when it works correctly, it conjures up a Patronus, which is a kind of anti-dementor — a guardian that acts as a shield between you and the dementor. The Patronus is a kind of positive force, a projection of the very things that the dementor feeds upon — hope, happiness, the desire to survive — but it cannot feel despair, as real humans can, so the dementors can’t hurt it. But I must warn you, Harry, that the charm might be too advanced for you. Many qualified wizards have difficulty with it. Each one is unique to the wizard who conjures it. With an incantation, which will work only if you are concentrating, with all your might, on a single, very happy memory. Expecto Patronum. Concentrating hard on your happy memory? Very good, Right, then — ready to try it on a dementor? Harry! Are you all right? Harry, if you don’t want to continue, I will more than understand — All right then . . . , You might want to select another memory, a happy memory, I mean, to concentrate on. . . . That one doesn’t seem to have been strong enough. . . . Ready? Go! Harry! Harry . . . wake up. . . . You heard James? I — I did, as a matter of fact, We were friends at Hogwarts. Listen, Harry — perhaps we should leave it here for tonight. This charm is ridiculously advanced. . . . I shouldn’t have suggested putting you through this. . . . Ready? Go! Riddikulus! Go! Excellent, Harry! That was definitely a start! Not now, You’ve had enough for one night. Here — Eat the lot, or Madam Pomfrey will be after my blood. Same time next week? What gives you that idea? Yes, I knew him, Or I thought I did. You’d better be off, Harry, it’s getting late. You’re expecting too much of yourself, For a thirteen-year-old wizard, even an indistinct Patronus is a huge achievement. You aren’t passing out anymore, are you? The true Patronus does do that, But you’ve achieved a great deal in a very short space of time. If the dementors put in an appearance at your next Quidditch match, you will be able to keep them at bay long enough to get back to the ground. I have complete confidence in you, Here — you’ve earned a drink — something from the Three Broomsticks.You won’t have tried it before — I see, Well — let’s drink to a Gryffindor victory against Ravenclaw! Not that I’m supposed to take sides, as a teacher . . . , Hmmm . . . well, the only people who really know are in no condition to tell us. You see, the dementor lowers its hood only to use its last and worst weapon. They call it the Dementor’s Kiss, It’s what dementors do to those they wish to destroy utterly. I suppose there must be some kind of mouth under there, because they clamp their jaws upon the mouth of the victim and — and suck out his soul. Oh no, But you’ll have no sense of self anymore, no memory, no . . . anything. There’s no chance at all of recovery. You’ll just — exist. As an empty shell. And your soul is gone forever . . . lost. It’s the fate that awaits Sirius Black. It was in the Daily Prophet this morning. The Ministry have given the dementors permission to perform it if they find him. That was quite some Patronus, You gave Mr. Malfoy quite a fright, You called, Severus?” “It looks like a Zonko product to me —” “Harry, Ron, come with me, I need a word about my vampire essay — excuse us, Severus —” “I don’t want to hear explanations,” Because . . . , because these mapmakers would have wanted to lure you out of school. They’d think it extremely entertaining. We’ve met, Don’t expect me to cover up for you again, Harry. I cannot make you take Sirius Black seriously. But I would have thought that what you have heard when the dementors draw near you would have had more of an effect on you. Your parents gave their lives to keep you alive, Harry. A poor way to repay them — gambling their sacrifice for a bag of magic tricks. Expelliarmus! “Where is he, Sirius?” But then . . . , . . . why hasn’t he shown himself before now? Unless unless he was the one . . . unless you switched . . . without telling me? Hermione — Hermione, calm down — You’re wrong, I haven’t been Sirius’s friend, but I am now — Let me explain. . . . Not at all up to your usual standard, Hermione, Only one out of three, I’m afraid. I have not been helping Sirius get into the castle and I certainly don’t want Harry dead. . . . But I won’t deny that I am a werewolf. “How long have you known?” He’ll be delighted, He assigned that essay hoping someone would realize what my symptoms meant. . . . Did you check the lunar chart and realize that I was always ill at the full moon? Or did you realize that the boggart changed into the moon when it saw me? You’re the cleverest witch of your age I’ve ever met, Hermione. But they already know, At least, the staff do. I have not been helping Sirius, If you’ll give me a chance, I’ll explain. Look — There, You’re armed, we’re not. Now will you listen? The map, The Marauder’s Map. I was in my office examining it — Of course I know how to work it, I helped write it. I’m Moony — that was my friends’ nickname for me at school. The important thing is, I was watching it carefully this evening, because I had an idea that you, Ron, and Hermione might try and sneak out of the castle to visit Hagrid before his hippogriff was executed. And I was right, wasn’t I? You might have been wearing your father’s old Cloak, Harry — The number of times I saw James disappearing under it . . . , The point is, even if you’re wearing an Invisibility Cloak, you still show up on the Marauder’s Map. I watched you cross the grounds and enter Hagrid’s hut. Twenty minutes later, you left Hagrid, and set off back toward the castle. But you were now accompanied by somebody else. I couldn’t believe my eyes, I thought the map must be malfunctioning. How could he be with you? And then I saw another dot, moving fast toward you, labeled Sirius Black. . . . I saw him collide with you; I watched as he pulled two of you into the Whomping Willow — No, Ron, Two of you. Do you think I could have a look at the rat? Everything, Could I see him, please? That’s not a rat, No, he’s not, He’s a wizard. Sirius, NO! WAIT! You can’t do it just like that — they need to understand — we’ve got to explain — They’ve — got — a — right — to — know — everything! Ron’s kept him as a pet! There are parts of it even I don’t understand! And Harry — you owe Harry the truth, Sirius! You’re going to hear me out, Ron, Just keep a tight hold on Peter while you listen. Everyone thought Sirius killed Peter, I believed it myself — until I saw the map tonight. Because the Marauder’s Map never lies . . . Peter’s alive. Ron’s holding him, Harry. Why can’t it be true? Right again, Hermione! But the Ministry never knew that there used to be three unregistered Animagi running around Hogwarts. All right . . . but you’ll need to help me, Sirius, I only know how it began . . . No one there . . . It’s not, The Shrieking Shack was never haunted. . . . The screams and howls the villagers used to hear were made by me. That’s where all of this starts — with my becoming a werewolf. None of this could have happened if I hadn’t been bitten . . . and if I hadn’t been so foolhardy. . . . I was a very small boy when I received the bite. My parents tried everything, but in those days there was no cure. The potion that Professor Snape has been making for me is a very recent discovery. It makes me safe, you see. As long as I take it in the week preceding the full moon, I keep my mind when I transform. . . . I am able to curl up in my office, a harmless wolf, and wait for the moon to wane again. Before the Wolfsbane Potion was discovered, however, I became a fully fledged monster once a month. It seemed impossible that I would be able to come to Hogwarts. Other parents weren’t likely to want their children exposed to me. he said. He said that as long as we took certain precautions, there was no reason I shouldn’t come to school. . . . I told you, months ago, that the Whomping Willow was planted the year I came to Hogwarts. The truth is that it was planted because I came to Hogwarts. This house the tunnel that leads to it — they were built for my use. Once a month, I was smuggled out of the castle, into this place, to transform. The tree was placed at the tunnel mouth to stop anyone coming across me while I was dangerous. My transformations in those days were — were terrible. It is very painful to turn into a werewolf. I was separated from humans to bite, so I bit and scratched myself instead. The villagers heard the noise and the screaming and thought they were hearing particularly violent spirits. Dumbledore encouraged the rumor. . . . Even now, when the house has been silent for years, the villagers don’t dare approach it. . . . But apart from my transformations, I was happier than I had ever been in my life. For the first time ever, I had friends, three great friends. Sirius Black . . . Peter Pettigrew . . . and, of course, your father, Harry — James Potter. Now, my three friends could hardly fail to notice that I disappeared once a month. I made up all sorts of stories. I told them my mother was ill, and that I had to go home to see her. . . . I was terrified they would desert me the moment they found out what I was. But of course, they, like you, Hermione, worked out the truth. . . . And they didn’t desert me at all. Instead, they did something for me that would make my transformations not only bearable, but the best times of my life. They became Animagi. Yes, indeed, It took them the best part of three years to work out how to do it. Peter needed all the help he could get from James and Sirius. Finally, in our fifth year, they managed it. They could each turn into a different animal at will. They couldn’t keep me company as humans, so they kept me company as animals, A werewolf is only a danger to people. They sneaked out of the castle every month under James’s Invisibility Cloak. They transformed . . . Peter, as the smallest, could slip beneath the Willow’s attacking branches and touch the knot that freezes it. They would then slip down the tunnel and join me. Under their influence, I became less dangerous. My body was still wolfish, but my mind seemed to become less so while I was with them. I’m getting there, Sirius, I’m getting there . . . well, highly exciting possibilities were open to us now that we could all transform. Soon we were leaving the Shrieking Shack and roaming the school grounds and the village by night. Sirius and James transformed into such large animals, they were able to keep a werewolf in check. I doubt whether any Hogwarts students ever found out more about the Hogwarts grounds and Hogsmeade than we did. . . . And that’s how we came to write the Marauder’s Map, and sign it with our nicknames. Sirius is Padfoot. Peter is Wormtail. James was Prongs. I sometimes felt guilty about betraying Dumbledore’s trust, of course . . . he had admitted me to Hogwarts when no other headmaster would have done so, and he had no idea I was breaking the rules he had set down for my own and others’ safety. He never knew I had led three fellow students into becoming Animagi illegally. But I always managed to forget my guilty feelings every time we sat down to plan our next month’s adventure. And I haven’t changed. . . . But I didn’t do it. Why? Because I was too cowardly. It would have meant admitting that I’d betrayed his trust while I was at school, admitting that I’d led others along with me . . . and Dumbledore’s trust has meant everything to me. He let me into Hogwarts as a boy, and he gave me a job when I have been shunned all my adult life, unable to find paid work because of what I am. And so I convinced myself that Sirius was getting into the school using Dark Arts he learned from Voldemort, that being an Animagus had nothing to do with it . . . so, in a way, Snape’s been right about me all along. He’s here, Sirius, He’s teaching here as well. Professor Snape was at school with us. He fought very hard against my appointment to the Defense Against the Dark Arts job. He has been telling Dumbledore all year that I am not to be trusted. He has his reasons . . . you see, Sirius here played a trick on him which nearly killed him, a trick which involved me — Severus was very interested in where I went every month, He especially disliked James. Well, of course, Snape tried it — if he’d got as far as this house, he’d have met a fully grown werewolf — but your father, who’d heard what Sirius had done, went after Snape and pulled him back, at great risk to his life . . . Snape glimpsed me, though, at the end of the tunnel. He was forbidden by Dumbledore to tell anybody, but from that time on he knew what I was. . . . That’s right, Thank you, Harry, How did you get this? My God, His front paw . . . Didn’t you ever hear, Ron? The biggest bit of Peter they found was his finger. Twelve years, in fact, Didn’t you ever wonder why he was living so long? Not looking too good at the moment, though, is he? I’d guess he’s been losing weight ever since he heard Sirius was on the loose again. . . . Harry, don’t you see? All this time we’ve thought Sirius betrayed your parents, and Peter tracked him down — but it was the other way around, don’t you see? Peter betrayed your mother and father — Sirius tracked Peter down — Enough of this,   There’s one certain way to prove what really happened. Ron, give me that rat. Ready, Sirius? I think so, On the count of three. One — two — THREE! Well, hello, Peter, Long time, no see. We’ve been having a little chat, Peter, about what happened the night Lily and James died. You might have missed the finer points while you were squeaking around down there on the bed — So we’ve heard, I’d like to clear up one or two little matters with you, Peter, if you’d be so — No one’s going to try and kill you until we’ve sorted a few things out, You knew Sirius was going to break out of Azkaban? When nobody has ever done it before? Certainly, Hermione, Not if he thought I was the spy, Peter, Not at all, Padfoot, old friend, And will you, in turn, forgive me for believing you were the spy? Yes, I think so, You should have realized, if Voldemort didn’t kill you, we would. Good-bye, Peter. Very well, Stand aside, Harry. Right, Ron, I can’t mend bones nearly as well as Madam Pomfrey, so I think it’s best if we just strap your leg up until we can get you to the hospital wing. Ferula. There’s nothing seriously wrong with him, You were just a little — overenthusiastic. Still out cold. Er — perhaps it will be best if we don’t revive him until we’re safely back in the castle. We can take him like this. . . . Mobilicorpus. I’ll do it, One wrong move, Peter, I saw you coming, I’m afraid it is, That was the final straw for Severus. I think the loss of the Order of Merlin hit him hard. So he — er — accidentally let slip that I am a werewolf this morning at breakfast. This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving from parents. . . . They will not want a werewolf teaching their children, Harry. And after last night, I see their point. I could have bitten any of you. . . . That must never happen again. From what the headmaster told me this morning, you saved a lot of lives last night, Harry. If I’m proud of anything, it’s how much you’ve learned. . . . Tell me about your Patronus. I am no longer your teacher, so I don’t feel guilty about giving you this back as well. It’s no use to me, and I daresay you, Ron, and Hermione will find uses for it. And so we would have, I have no hesitation in saying that James would have been highly disappointed if his son had never found any of the secret passages out of the castle. Thank you, Headmaster. It has been a real pleasure teaching you. I feel sure we’ll meet again sometime. Headmaster, there is no need to see me to the gates, I can manage. . . . It’s all right, Harry. We’ve come to take you away. That’s him, Mad-Eye, “Almost at once,” “we’re just waiting for the all-clear.” “Not the Burrow, no,” Too risky. This is Alastor Moody, Harry,” “And this is Nymphadora —” “Elphias Doge” “— Emmeline Vance” “and Hestia Jones.” A surprising number of people volunteered to come and get you, We’re just waiting for the signal to tell us it’s safe to set off, We’ve got about fifteen minutes. Brooms, He’s excellent, Anyway, you’d better go and get packed, Harry, we want to be ready to go when the signal comes. Excellent, We’ve got about a minute, I think. We should probably get out into the garden so we’re ready. Harry, I’ve left a letter telling your aunt and uncle not to worry — In a minute. Think about what you’ve just memorized, It looks wonderful, Molly, I think it depends what they’re offered, And I’m not talking about gold; if they’re offered freedoms we’ve been denying them for centuries they’re going to be tempted. Have you still not had any luck with Ragnok, Bill? Personally, I think it better that Harry gets the facts — not all the facts, Molly, but the general picture — from us, rather than a garbled version from . . . others. Sirius? Sirius, sit down. I think Harry ought to be allowed a say in this, He’s old enough to decide for himself. More than he thinks we do anyway, Or rather, you messed it up for him, And the very last person he wanted alerted to his return the moment he got back was Dumbledore, And you made sure Dumbledore knew at once. Dumbledore’s got a shrewd idea, and Dumbledore’s shrewd ideas normally turn out to be accurate. We’re doing our best, But it seems that he’s become fond of power now, and much more confident. He loves being Minister of Magic, and he’s managed to convince himself that he’s the clever one and Dumbledore’s simply stirring up trouble for the sake of it. You see the problem, While the Ministry insists there is nothing to fear from Voldemort, it’s hard to convince people he’s back, especially as they really don’t want to believe it in the first place. What’s more, the Ministry’s leaning heavily on the Daily Prophet not to report any of what they’re calling Dumbledore’s rumor-mongering, so most of the Wizarding community are completely unaware anything’s happened, and that makes them easy targets for the Death Eaters if they’re using the Imperius Curse. And I’m not a very popular dinner guest with most of the community, It’s an occupational hazard of being a werewolf. They’re trying to discredit him, Didn’t you see the Daily Prophet last week? They’ve demoted him from Chief Warlock on the Wizengamot — that’s the Wizard High Court — and they’re talking about taking away his Order of Merlin, First Class, too.  What were you saying about Scrimgeour? The law’s on your side, Even underage wizards are allowed to use magic in life-threatening situations. Good luck, I’m sure it will be fine. He’ll have had his reasons, What’s going on? Riddikulus! Riddikulus! RIDDIKULUS! Molly, Molly, don’t . . . Molly, Just a stupid boggart . . . Molly, This isn’t like last time. The Order is better prepared, we’ve got a head start, we know what Voldemort’s up to — Molly, And as for who’s going to look after Ron and Ginny if you and Arthur died, what do you think we’d do, let them starve? Nothing, Well, look after yourselves, You too, Harry. Be careful. Look after yourselves, And listen . . . Harry, I know you don’t like Snape, but he is a superb Occlumens and we all — Sirius included — want you to learn to protect yourself, so work hard, all right? What are you — what’s happened, is everything all right? I’ll call him, He went upstairs to look for Kreacher, he seems to be hiding in the attic again . . . I wouldn’t like you to judge your father on what you saw there, Harry. He was only fifteen — Look, Harry, Was he playing with the Snitch? She started going out with him in seventh year, And stopped hexing people just for the fun of it, Well, Snape was a special case. I mean, he never lost an opportunity to curse James, so you couldn’t really expect James to take that lying down, could you? Now you mention it, how did Snape react when he found you’d seen all this? Are you serious, Harry? He’s stopped giving you lessons? But Harry, first of all, you’re to go back to Snape and tell him that on no account is he to stop giving you lessons — when Dumbledore hears — Do you understand me? Nothing! Harry, There’s nothing you can do, Harry — “It’s too late, Harry —” There’s nothing you can do, Harry . . . nothing. . . . He’s gone. Hello, Hi, Well, we thought we might have a little chat with your aunt and uncle before letting them take you home. There have been another couple of dementor attacks, And they’ve found Igor Karkaroff’s body in a shack up north. The Dark Mark had been set over it — well, frankly, I’m surprised he stayed alive for even a year after deserting the Death Eaters; Sirius’s brother, Regulus, only managed a few days as far as I can remember. They’ll make do with other makers, But Ollivander was the best, and if the other side have got him it’s not so good for us. Oh, I’ve been underground, Almost literally. That’s why I haven’t been able to write, Harry; sending letters to you would have been something of a giveaway. I’ve been living among my fellows, my equals, Werewolves, Nearly all of them are on Voldemort’s side. Dumbledore wanted a spy and here I was . . . ready-made. I am not complaining; it is necessary work and who can do it better than I? However, it has been difficult gaining their trust. I bear the unmistakable signs of having tried to live among wizards, you see, whereas they have shunned normal society and live on the margins, stealing — and sometimes killing — to eat. They think that, under his rule, they will have a better life. And it is hard to argue with Greyback out there. . . . You haven’t heard of him? Fenrir Greyback is, perhaps, the most savage werewolf alive today. He regards it as his mission in life to bite and to contaminate as many people as possible; he wants to create enough werewolves to overcome the wizards. Voldemort has promised him prey in return for his services. Greyback specializes in children. . . . Bite them young, he says, and raise them away from their parents, raise them to hate normal wizards. Voldemort has threatened to unleash him upon people’s sons and daughters; it is a threat that usually produces good results. It was Greyback who bit me. I did not know, for a very long time, the identity of the werewolf who had attacked me; I even felt pity for him, thinking that he had had no control, knowing by then how it felt to transform. He plans it all. And this is the man Voldemort is using to marshal the werewolves. I cannot pretend that my particular brand of reasoned argument is making much headway against Greyback’s insistence that we werewolves deserve blood, that we ought to revenge ourselves on normal people. Sometimes you remind me a lot of James. He called it my ‘furry little problem’ in company. Many people were under the impression that I owned a badly behaved rabbit. What? Prince, There are no Wizarding princes, Is this a title you’re thinking of adopting? I should have thought being ‘the Chosen One’ would be enough. Oh, that one had a great vogue during my time at Hogwarts, There were a few months in my fifth year when you couldn’t move for being hoisted into the air by your ankle. Yes, but he wasn’t the only one. As I say, it was very popular. . . . You know how these spells come and go. . . . Definitely not. How old is this book, Harry? Well, perhaps that will give you some clue as to when the Prince was at Hogwarts, Sometimes . . . a great shock . . . an emotional upheaval . . . It’s fine, Fine, Are you all right, Harry? No, I don’t think that Bill will be a true werewolf, but that does not mean that there won’t be some contamination. Those are cursed wounds. They are unlikely ever to heal fully, and — and Bill might have some wolfish characteristics from now on. No! “Snape was a highly accomplished Occlumens, We always knew that.” And Dumbledore believed that? Dumbledore believed Snape was sorry James was dead? Snape hated James. . . . It isn’t your fault, Minerva, We all wanted more help, we were glad to think Snape was on his way. . . . Luckily, Ron, Ginny, and Neville ran into us almost immediately and told us what had happened. We found the Death Eaters minutes later, heading in the direction of the Astronomy Tower. Malfoy obviously hadn’t expected more people to be on the watch; he seemed to have exhausted his supply of Darkness Powder, at any rate. A fight broke out, they scattered and we gave chase. One of them, Gibbon, broke away and headed up the tower stairs — He must have done, yes, they must have arranged that before they left the Room of Requirement, But I don’t think Gibbon liked the idea of waiting up there alone for Dumbledore, because he came running back downstairs to rejoin the fight and was hit by a Killing Curse that just missed me. I saw him run straight through the cursed barrier as though it wasn’t there, I tried to follow him, but was thrown back just like Neville. . . . Well, the big Death Eater had just fired off a hex that caused half the ceiling to fall in, and also broke the curse blocking the stairs, There will probably be some contamination, Arthur, It is an odd case, possibly unique. . . . We don’t know what his behavior might be like when he awakens. . . . It’s different, Bill will not be a full werewolf. The cases are completely — And I’ve told you a million times, that I am too old for you, too poor . . . too dangerous. . . . I am not being ridiculous, Tonks deserves somebody young and whole. This is . . . not the moment to discuss it, Dumbledore is dead. . . . We’re one short, ‘Harry is the best hope we have. It’s him, I’ve checked! So it seems, but apparently they did not realize that there would be seven Harrys. Only Harry, Hagrid, George, and me. What happened to you? Harry behaved a little too kindly to Stan Shunpike, He lost an ear, Snape’s work, He lost his hood during the chase. Sectumsempra was always a speciality of Snape’s. I wish I could say I’d paid him back in kind, but it was all I could do to keep George on the broom after he was injured, he was losing so much blood. So Mundungus disappeared? No, I think you’re like James, who would have regarded it as the height of dishonor to mistrust his friends. There’s work to do. I can ask Kingsley whether — Mad-Eye’s body, We need to recover it. We shouldn’t be here, It was not I who killed you, Albus, Hold your fire, it’s me, Remus! Speaking as your ex-Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, I quite agree that you had to check. Ron, Hermione, you shouldn’t be quite so quick to lower your defenses. No sign of Severus, then? Yes, but we’re all being watched. There are a couple of Death Eaters in the square outside — I had to Apparate very precisely onto the top step outside the front door to be sure that they would not see me. They can’t know you’re in here or I’m sure they’d have more people out there; they’re staking out everywhere that’s got any connection with you, Harry. Let’s go downstairs, there’s a lot to tell you, and I want to know what happened after you left the Burrow. I’d have been here three days ago but I needed to shake off the Death Eater tailing me, So, you came straight here after the wedding? What? But how did they find you so quickly? It’s impossible to track anyone who Apparates, unless you grab hold of them as they disappear! Impossible, Apart from anything else, they’d know for sure Harry was here if he still had the Trace on him, wouldn’t they? But I can’t see how they could have tracked you to Tottenham Court Road, that’s worrying, really worrying. Well, Kingsley saved us, Thanks to his warning most of the wedding guests were able to Disapparate before they arrived. A mixture; but to all intents and purposes they’re the same thing now, There were about a dozen of them, but they didn’t know you were there, Harry. Arthur heard a rumor that they tried to torture your whereabouts out of Scrimgeour before they killed him; if it’s true, he didn’t give you away. The Death Eaters searched the Burrow from top to bottom, They found the ghoul, but didn’t want to get too close — and then they interrogated those of us who remained for hours. They were trying to get information on you, Harry, but of course nobody apart from the Order knew that you had been there. At the same time that they were smashing up the wedding, more Death Eaters were forcing their way into every Order-connected house in the country. No deaths, but they were rough. They burned down Dedalus Diggle’s house, but as you know he wasn’t there  and they used the Cruciatus Curse on Tonks’s family. They’re all right — shaken, obviously, but otherwise okay. What you’ve got to realize, Harry, is that the Death Eaters have got the full might of the Ministry on their side now, They’ve got the power to perform brutal spells without fear of identification or arrest. They managed to penetrate every defensive spell we’d cast against them, and once inside, they were completely open about why they’d come. Well, Here, you’ll know sooner or later anyway. That’s their pretext for going after you. I’m sorry, Harry, The coup has been smooth and virtually silent, The official version of Scrimgeour’s murder is that he resigned; he has been replaced by Pius Thicknesse, who is under the Imperius Curse. He doesn’t need to, Ron. Effectively he is the Minister, but why should he sit behind a desk at the Ministry? His puppet, Thicknesse, is taking care of everyday business, leaving Voldemort free to extend his power beyond the Ministry. Naturally many people have deduced what has happened: There has been such a dramatic change in Ministry policy in the last few days, and many are whispering that Voldemort must be behind it. However, that is the point: They whisper. They daren’t confide in each other, not knowing whom to trust; they are scared to speak out, in case their suspicions are true and their families are targeted. Yes, Voldemort is playing a very clever game. Declaring himself might have provoked open rebellion: Remaining masked has created confusion, uncertainty, and fear. That’s certainly part of it, and it is a masterstroke. Now that Dumbledore is dead, you — the Boy Who Lived — were sure to be the symbol and rallying point for any resistance to Voldemort. But by suggesting that you had a hand in the old hero’s death, Voldemort has not only set a price upon your head, but sown doubt and fear amongst many who would have defended you. Meanwhile, the Ministry has started moving against Muggle-borns. It is happening, Ron, Muggle-borns are being rounded up as we speak. Yes, Nevertheless, unless you can prove that you have at least one close Wizarding relative, you are now deemed to have obtained your magical power illegally and must suffer the punishment. Attendance is now compulsory for every young witch and wizard, That was announced yesterday. It’s a change, because it was never obligatory before. Of course, nearly every witch and wizard in Britain has been educated at Hogwarts, but their parents had the right to teach them at home or send them abroad if they preferred. This way, Voldemort will have the whole Wizarding population under his eye from a young age. And it’s also another way of weeding out Muggle-borns, because students must be given Blood Status — meaning that they have proven to the Ministry that they are of Wizard descent — before they are allowed to attend. I’ll understand if you can’t confirm this, Harry, but the Order is under the impression that Dumbledore left you a mission. What? I thought you’d say that, But I might still be of some use to you. You know what I am and what I can do. I could come with you to provide protection. There would be no need to tell me exactly what you were up to. What about her? Tonks will be perfectly safe, She’ll be at her parents’ house. Everything is fine, thank you, Tonks is going to have a baby. So . . . do you accept my offer? Will three become four? And I must tell you that I believe that we are facing magic many of us have never encountered or imagined. She’ll be perfectly safe there, they’ll look after her, Harry, I’m sure James would have wanted me to stick with you. You don’t understand, I — I made a grave mistake in marrying Tonks. I did it against my better judgment and I have regretted it very much ever since. Don’t you understand what I’ve done to my wife and my unborn child? I should never have married her, I’ve made her an outcast! You have only ever seen me amongst the Order, or under Dumbledore’s protection at Hogwarts! You don’t know how most of the Wizarding world sees creatures like me! When they know of my affliction, they can barely talk to me! Don’t you see what I’ve done? Even her own family is disgusted by our marriage, what parents want their only daughter to marry a werewolf? And the child — the child — My kind don’t usually breed! And if, by some miracle, it is not like me, then it will be better off, a hundred times so, without a father of whom it must always be ashamed! How — how dare you? Hi. Thanks, River, I do, There is no doubt at all in my mind that his death would be proclaimed as widely as possible by the Death Eaters if it had happened, because it would strike a deadly blow at the morale of those resisting the new regime. ‘The Boy Who Lived’ remains a symbol of everything for which we are fighting: the triumph of good, the power of innocence, the need to keep resisting. Nearly always right, Well, as regular listeners will know, several of the more outspoken supporters of Harry Potter have now been imprisoned, including Xenophilius Lovegood, erstwhile editor of The Quibbler, It would tend to give you an edge, May I just add that while we here at Potterwatch applaud Hagrid’s spirit, we would urge even the most devoted of Harry’s supporters against following Hagrid’s lead. ‘Support Harry Potter’ parties are unwise in the present climate. It is I, Remus John Lupin! I am a werewolf, married to Nymphadora Tonks, and you, the Secret-Keeper of Shell Cottage, told me the address and bade me come in an emergency! It’s a boy! We’ve named him Ted, after Dora’s father! Yes — yes — a boy, You’ll be godfather? You, yes, of course — Dora quite agrees, no one better — I can’t stay long, I must get back, Thank you, thank you, Bill. To Teddy Remus Lupin, a great wizard in the making! I think he looks like Dora, but she thinks he is like me. Not much hair.It looked black when he was born, but I swear it’s turned ginger in the hour since. Probably be blond by the time I get back. Andromeda says Tonks’s hair started changing color the day that she was born. Oh, go on then, just one more, No . . . no . . . I really must get back, Good-bye, good-bye — I’ll try and bring some pictures in a few days’ time — they’ll all be so glad to know that I’ve seen you — Harry, what’s happening? I — oh yes — he’s fine! Yes, Tonks is with him — at her mother’s — Here, I’ve got a picture! Molly, how about this, Why doesn’t Ginny stay here, then at least she’ll be on the scene and know what’s going on, but she won’t be in the middle of the fighting? And he will want it to be quick. He wants it over, I am sorry too, Sorry I will never know him . . . but he will know why I died and I hope he will understand. I was trying to make a world in which he could live a happier life.",

He’s that tall, good-looking one, isn’t he? How did you do that? OUCH! Well, I’ve done it! Just put my name in! I had my birthday last week, Thanks, Hermione, Oh if it couldn’t be me, at least it’s a Gryffindor — Sorry I was a bit short with you earlier, Potter, Look, I know he’s your best mate, but he’s not fabulous, I think with a bit of training he’ll be all right, though. He comes from a family of good Quidditch players. I’m banking on him turning out to have a bit more talent than he showed today, to be honest. Anyway, we’re having a practice session at two o’clock tomorrow, so just make sure you’re there this time. And do me a favor and help Ron as much as you can, okay? Okay everyone, Let’s get to it; Alicia and Fred, if you can just bring the ball crate out for us. Oh, and there are a couple of people out there watching but I want you to just ignore them, all right? Harry  Okay everyone, we’re going to start with some passes just to warm up, the whole team please — Spread out, then, and let’s see what we can do . . . Pass it on, Ron, Come on now, Ron, Pay attention. Get back in position, she’s fine! But as you’re passing to a teammate, do try not to knock her off her broom, won’t you? We’ve got Bludgers for that! Harry  Fred, George, go and get your bats and a Bludger; We’re going to aim for Ron’s goal Stop — stop — STOP! Ron — you’re not covering your middle post! You keep shifting around while you’re watching the Chasers! Either stay in center position until you have to move to defend a hoop, or else circle the hoops, but don’t drift vaguely off to one side, that’s how you let in the last three goals! And Katie, can’t you do something about that nosebleed? Well, let’s try again, Katie, She needs the hospital wing, Well, there’s no point continuing with no Beaters and a Chaser gone, Come on, let’s go and get changed. But Professor — he’s gone and landed himself in detention again — Hang on, we need to make sure this doesn’t clash with our Quidditch practice. As long as — No Quidditch practice, I know, I know, She just said she needed a bit of time to consider. I’ve got permission! To re-form the Quidditch team! Yeah, I went to McGonagall and I think she might have appealed to Dumbledore — anyway, Umbridge had to give in. Ha! All right, everyone, listen up, I know it’s not ideal weather, but there’s a good chance we’ll be playing Slytherin in conditions like this so it’s a good idea to work out how we’re going to cope with them. Harry, didn’t you do something to your glasses to stop the rain fogging them up when we played Hufflepuff in that storm? Impervius! I think we all ought to try that, If we could just keep the rain off our faces it would really help visibility — all together, come on — Impervius! Okay. Let’s go. Can we be the Anti-Umbridge League? The Quidditch season’s about to start, we need team practices too! When you’re ready, we’re going to go straight down to the pitch, check out conditions and change. Okay, I’ve only just found out the final lineup for Slytherin, Last year’s Beaters, Derrick and Bole, have left now, but it looks as though Montague’s replaced them with the usual gorillas, rather than anyone who can fly particularly well. They’re two blokes called Crabbe and Goyle, I don’t know much about them — Well, they don’t look bright enough to tell one end of a broom from another, but then I was always surprised Derrick and Bole managed to find their way onto the pitch without signposts. It’s time, C’mon everyone . . . good luck. Harry, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? GET GOING! You all right? It was that thug, Crabbe, He whacked the Bludger at you the moment he saw you’d got the Snitch — but we won, Harry, we won! Talk about sour grapes, Leave it, Leave it, Fred, let him yell, he’s just sore he lost, the jumped-up little — Banned, etc., etc. …’ ”  No Seeker and no Beaters . . . What on earth are we going to do? I’m going to bed, Maybe this will all turn out to have been a bad dream. . . . Maybe I’ll wake up tomorrow and find we haven’t played yet . . . Well, we’ve replaced you. You and Fred and George, We’ve got another Seeker! Yeah, I know, But she’s pretty good, actually. Nothing on you, of course, but as we can’t have you . . . But why sack Hagrid now?",

You don’t understand. . . . “Get off,” An Animagus, by the name of Peter Pettigrew. I meant to, but little Peter got the better of me ... not this time, though! We can explain afterwards! All right, then, Tell them whatever you like. But make it quick, Remus. I want to commit the murder I was imprisoned for. . . . They didn’t see what they thought they saw! If you’re going to tell them the story, get a move on, Remus, I’ve waited twelve years, I’m not going to wait much longer. Hurry up, Remus, Snape? What’s Snape got to do with it? It served him right, Sneaking around, trying to find out what we were up to . . . hoping he could get us expelled. . . . You shouldn’t have done that, You should have left him to me. . . . Then it’s time we offered you some proof, You, boy — give me Peter. Now. Okay, say Pettigrew could turn into a rat — there are millions of rats — how’s he supposed to know which one he’s after if he was locked up in Azkaban? Fudge, When he came to inspect Azkaban last year, he gave me his paper. And there was Peter, on the front page . . . on this boy’s shoulder. . . . I knew him at once . . . how many times had I seen him transform? And the caption said the boy would be going back to Hogwarts . . . to where Harry was. . . . He’s got a toe missing, Just before he transformed, When I cornered him, he yelled for the whole street to hear that I’d betrayed Lily and James. Then, before I could curse him, he blew apart the street with the wand behind his back, killed everyone within twenty feet of himself — and sped down into the sewer with the other rats. . . . This cat isn’t mad, He’s the most intelligent of his kind I’ve ever met. He recognized Peter for what he was right away. And when he met me, he knew I was no dog. It was a while before he trusted me. . . . Finally, I managed to communicate to him what I was after, and he’s been helping me. . . . He tried to bring Peter to me, but couldn’t . . . so he stole the passwords into Gryffindor Tower for me. . . . As I understand it, he took them from a boy’s bedside table. . . . But Peter got wind of what was going on and ran for it. . . . croaked Black. This cat — Crookshanks, did you call him? — told me Peter had left blood on the sheets. . . . I supposed he bit himself. . . . Well, faking his own death had worked once. . . . Yes, I have, Harry, I persuaded Lily and James to change to Peter at the last moment, persuaded them to use him as Secret-Keeper instead of me. . . . I’m to blame, I know it. . . . The night they died, I’d arranged to check on Peter, make sure he was still safe, but when I arrived at his hiding place, he’d gone. Yet there was no sign of a struggle. It didn’t feel right. I was scared. I set out for your parents’ house straightaway. And when I saw their house, destroyed, and their bodies . . . I realized what Peter must’ve done . . . what I’d done. . . . Together? I don’t blame you, Peter. His lot aren’t very happy with you, are they? You haven’t been hiding from me for twelve years, You’ve been hiding from Voldemort’s old supporters. I heard things in Azkaban, Peter. . . . They all think you’re dead, or you’d have to answer to them. . . . I’ve heard them screaming all sorts of things in their sleep. Sounds like they think the double-crosser double-crossed them. Voldemort went to the Potters’ on your information . . . and Voldemort met his downfall there. And not all Voldemort’s supporters ended up in Azkaban, did they? There are still plenty out here, biding their time, pretending they’ve seen the error of their ways. . . . If they ever got wind that you were still alive, Peter — Remus, I, a spy for Voldemort? When did I ever sneak around people who were stronger and more powerful than myself? But you, Peter — I’ll never understand why I didn’t see you were the spy from the start. You always liked big friends who’d look after you, didn’t you?  It used to be us . . . me and Remus . . . and James. . . . Me, a spy . . . must be out of your mind . . . never . . . don’t know how you can say such a — Lily and James only made you Secret-Keeper because I suggested it, I thought it was the perfect plan . . . a bluff. . . . Voldemort would be sure to come after me, would never dream they’d use a weak, talentless thing like you. . . . It must have been the finest moment of your miserable life, telling Voldemort you could hand him the Potters. I’ll tell you why, Because you never did anything for anyone unless you could see what was in it for you. You weren’t about to commit murder right under Albus Dumbledore’s nose, for a wreck of a wizard who’d lost all of his power, were you? You’d want to be quite sure he was the biggest bully in the playground before you went back to him, wouldn’t you? Why else did you find a wizard family to take you in? Keeping an ear out for news, weren’t you, Peter? Just in case your old protector regained strength, and it was safe to rejoin him. . . . . . . ready to strike at the moment he could be sure of allies . . . and to deliver the last Potter to them. If he gave them Harry, who’d dare say he’d betrayed Lord Voldemort? He’d be welcomed back with honors. . . . So you see, I had to do something. I was the only one who knew Peter was still alive. . . . It was as if someone had lit a fire in my head, and the dementors couldn’t destroy it. . . . It wasn’t a happy feeling . . . it was an obsession . . . but it gave me strength, it cleared my mind. So, one night when they opened my door to bring food, I slipped past them as a dog. . . . It’s so much harder for them to sense animal emotions that they were confused. . . . I was thin, very thin . . . thin enough to slip through the bars. . . . I swam as a dog back to the mainland. . . . I journeyed north and slipped into the Hogwarts grounds as a dog. I’ve been living in the forest ever since, except when I came to watch the Quidditch, of course. You fly as well as your father did, Harry. . . . Believe me, Believe me, I never betrayed James and Lily. I would have died before I betrayed them. Forgive me, Remus, Of course, Shall we kill him together? If you made a better rat than a human, it’s not much to boast about, Peter, HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO HARRY? HOW DARE YOU FACE HIM? HOW DARE YOU TALK ABOUT JAMES IN FRONT OF HIM? You sold Lily and James to Voldemort, Do you deny it? DON’T LIE! YOU’D BEEN PASSING INFORMATION TO HIM FOR A YEAR BEFORE LILY AND JAMES DIED! YOU WERE HIS SPY! What was there to be gained by fighting the most evil wizard who has ever existed? Only innocent lives, Peter! THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE DIED! DIED RATHER THAN BETRAY YOUR FRIENDS, AS WE WOULD HAVE DONE FOR YOU! Harry, This cringing bit of filth would have seen you die too, without turning a hair. You heard him. His own stinking skin meant more to him than your whole family. Harry, But think . . . think what he did. . . . But if you transform, Peter, we will kill you. You agree, Harry? And two of us should be chained to this, Just to make sure. You know what this means? Turning Pettigrew in? Well . . . your parents appointed me your guardian, If anything happened to them . . . But . . . well . . . think about it. Once my name’s cleared . . . if you wanted a . . . a different home . . . Of course, I thought you wouldn’t want to, I understand, I just thought I’d — You want to? You mean it? Never mind me, how are you? . . . I There are things I need to warn you about. Karkaroff, Harry, he was a Death Eater. You know what Death Eaters are, don’t you? He was caught, he was in Azkaban with me, but he got released. I’d bet everything that’s why Dumbledore wanted an Auror at Hogwarts this year — to keep an eye on him. Moody caught Karkaroff. Put him into Azkaban in the first place. . . . I He said he’d seen the error of his ways, and then he named names . . . he put a load of other people into Azkaban in his place. . . . He’s not very popular in there, I can tell you. And since he got out, from what I can tell, he’s been teaching the Dark Arts to every student who passes through that school of his. So watch out for the Durmstrang champion as well. We know he’s a good actor, because he convinced the Ministry of Magic to set him free, didn’t he? Now, I’ve been keeping an eye on the Daily Prophet, Harry — — and reading between the lines of that Skeeter woman’s article last month, Moody was attacked the night before he started at Hogwarts. Yes, I know she says it was another false alarm, but I don’t think so, somehow. I think someone tried to stop him from getting to Hogwarts. I think someone knew their job would be a lot more difficult with him around. And no one’s going to look into it too closely; Mad-Eye’s heard intruders a bit too often. But that doesn’t mean he can’t still spot the real thing. Moody was the best Auror the Ministry ever had. I’ve been hearing some very strange things, The Death Eaters seem to be a bit more active than usual lately. They showed themselves at the Quidditch World Cup, didn’t they? Someone set off the Dark Mark . . . and then — did you hear about that Ministry of Magic witch who’s gone missing? Exactly . . . she disappeared in Albania, and that’s definitely where Voldemort was rumored to be last . . . and she would have known the Triwizard Tournament was coming up, wouldn’t she? Listen, I knew Bertha Jorkins, She was at Hogwarts when I was, a few years above your dad and me. And she was an idiot. Very nosy, but no brains, none at all. It’s not a good combination, Harry. I’d say she’d be very easy to lure into a trap. I don’t know, I just don’t know . . . Karkaroff doesn’t strike me as the type who’d go back to Voldemort unless he knew Voldemort was powerful enough to protect him. Right — these dragons, There’s a way, Harry. Don’t be tempted to try a Stunning Spell — dragons are strong and too powerfully magical to be knocked out by a single Stunner, you need about half a dozen wizards at a time to overcome a dragon — But you can do it alone, There is a way, and a simple spell’s all you need. Just — Chicken! I’ve been living off rats mostly. Can’t steal too much food from Hogsmeade; I’d draw attention to myself. Fulfilling my duty as godfather, Don’t worry about it, I’m pretending to be a lovable stray. I want to be on the spot. Your last letter . . . well, let’s just say things are getting fishier. I’ve been stealing the paper every time someone throws one out, and by the looks of things, I’m not the only one who’s getting worried. You three and Dumbledore are the only ones around here who know I’m an Animagus, Crouch sacked his house-elf? You first saw the elf in the Top Box. She was saving Crouch a seat, right? But Crouch didn’t turn up for the match? Harry, did you check your pockets for your wand after you’d left the Top Box? It’s possible, The elf wasn’t the only one in that box, Who else was sitting behind you? Anyone else? Well? What’s he like? Does he, now? I wonder why he’d do that? Hmm, When the Dark Mark had been conjured, and the elf had been discovered holding Harry’s wand, what did Crouch do? Of course, of course, he’d want to pin it on anyone but his own elf . . . and then he sacked her? She’s got the measure of Crouch better than you have, Ron. If you want to know what a man’s like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals. . . . It’s not like Crouch. If he’s ever taken a day off work because of illness before this, I’ll eat Buckbeak. Oh I know Crouch all right, He was the one who gave the order for me to be sent to Azkaban — without a trial. No, Crouch used to be Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, didn’t you know? Oh never a Voldemort supporter, But then a lot of people who were against the Dark Side . . . well, you wouldn’t understand . . . you’re too young. . . . Right, Crouch’s principles might’ve been good in the beginning — I wouldn’t know. He rose quickly through the Ministry, and he started ordering very harsh measures against Voldemort’s supporters. The Aurors were given new powers — powers to kill rather than capture, for instance. And I wasn’t the only one who was handed straight to the dementors without trial. Crouch fought violence with violence, and authorized the use of the Unforgivable Curses against suspects. I would say he became as ruthless and cruel as many on the Dark Side. He had his supporters, mind you — plenty of people thought he was going about things the right way, and there were a lot of witches and wizards clamoring for him to take over as Minister of Magic. When Voldemort disappeared, it looked like only a matter of time until Crouch got the top job. But then something rather unfortunate happened. . . . Crouch’s own son was caught with a group of Death Eaters who’d managed to talk their way out of Azkaban. Apparently they were trying to find Voldemort and return him to power. Yep, Nasty little shock for old Barty, I’d imagine. Should have spent a bit more time at home with his family, shouldn’t he? Ought to have left the office early once in a while . . . gotten to know his own son. I was in Azkaban myself when he was brought in. This is mostly stuff I’ve found out since I got out. The boy was definitely caught in the company of people I’d bet my life were Death Eaters — but he might have been in the wrong place at the wrong time, just like the house-elf. Crouch let his son off? I thought you had the measure of him, Hermione! Anything that threatened to tarnish his reputation had to go; he had dedicated his whole life to becoming Minister of Magic. You saw him dismiss a devoted house-elf because she associated him with the Dark Mark again — doesn’t that tell you what he’s like? Crouch’s fatherly affection stretched just far enough to give his son a trial, and by all accounts, it wasn’t much more than an excuse for Crouch to show how much he hated the boy . . . then he sent him straight to Azkaban. That’s right, I saw the dementors bringing him in, watched them through the bars in my cell door. He can’t have been more than nineteen. They took him into a cell near mine. He was screaming for his mother by nightfall. He went quiet after a few days, though . . . they all went quiet in the end . . . except when they shrieked in their sleep. No, No, he’s not in there anymore. He died about a year after they brought him in. Most go mad in there, and plenty stop eating in the end. They lose the will to live. You could always tell when a death was coming, because the dementors could sense it, they got excited. That boy looked pretty sickly when he arrived. Crouch being an important Ministry member, he and his wife were allowed a deathbed visit. Wasted away just like the boy I watched them do it. So old Crouch lost it all, just when he thought he had it made, One moment, a hero, poised to become Minister of Magic . . . next, his son dead, his wife dead, the family name dishonored, and, so I’ve heard since I escaped, a big drop in popularity. The conclusion was that his father never cared much for him. Yep, If you ask me, he still thinks he can bring back the old popularity by catching one more Death Eater. Yep, Listen, if Crouch wants to investigate Snape, why hasn’t he been coming to judge the tournament? It would be an ideal excuse to make regular visits to Hogwarts and keep an eye on him. Rosier and Wilkes — they were both killed by Aurors the year before Voldemort fell. The Lestranges — they’re a married couple — they’re in Azkaban. Avery — from what I’ve heard he wormed his way out of trouble by saying he’d been acting under the Imperius Curse — he’s still at large. But as far as I know, Snape was never even accused of being a Death Eater — not that that means much. Plenty of them were never caught. And Snape’s certainly clever and cunning enough to keep himself out of trouble. He showed Snape something on his arm? Well, I’ve no idea what that’s about . . . but if Karkaroff’s genuinely worried, and he’s going to Snape for answers . . . Well, What? I wouldn’t put it past Mad-Eye to have searched every single teacher’s office when he got to Hogwarts. He takes his Defense Against the Dark Arts seriously, Moody. I’m not sure he trusts anyone at all, and after the things he’s seen, it’s not surprising. I’ll say this for Moody, though, he never killed if he could help it. Always brought people in alive where possible. He was tough, but he never descended to the level of the Death Eaters. Crouch, though . . . he’s a different matter . . . is he really ill? If he is, why did he make the effort to drag himself up to Snape’s office? And if he’s not . . . what’s he up to? What was he doing at the World Cup that was so important he didn’t turn up in the Top Box? What’s he been doing while he should have been judging the tournament? You say your brother’s Crouch’s personal assistant? Any chance you could ask him if he’s seen Crouch lately? Yep, Blustering on about how bad Bertha’s memory is. She was a bit dim, but she had an excellent memory for gossip. It used to get her into a lot of trouble; she never knew when to keep her mouth shut. I can see her being a bit of a liability at the Ministry of Magic . . . maybe that’s why Bagman didn’t bother to look for her for so long. . . . What’s the time? You’d better get back to school, Now listen . . . I don’t want you lot sneaking out of school to see me, all right? Just send notes to me here. I still want to hear about anything odd. But you’re not to go leaving Hogwarts without permission; it would be an ideal opportunity for someone to attack you. I don’t care . . . I’ll breathe freely again when this tournament’s over, and that’s not until June. And don’t forget, if you’re talking about me among yourselves, call me Snuffles, okay? I’ll walk to the edge of the village with you, see if I can scrounge another paper. Harry, are you all right? I knew it — I knew something like this — what happened? What happened? What happened? What happened? We can leave that till morning, can’t we, Dumbledore? Let him have a sleep. Let him rest. The wands connected? Why? The Reverse Spell effect? So what happens when a wand meets its brother? Diggory came back to life? You’ll see me very soon, Harry, I promise you. But I must do what I can, you understand, don’t you? Harry. My dear old mum, yeah, We’ve been trying to get her down for a month but we think she put a Permanent Sticking Charm on the back of the canvas. Let’s get downstairs, quick, before they all wake up again. Hasn’t anyone told you? This was my parents’ house, But I’m the last Black left, so it’s mine now. I offered it to Dumbledore for headquarters — about the only useful thing I’ve been able to do. Sit down, Harry, You’ve met Mundungus, haven’t you? Harry’s arrived. Had a good summer so far? Don’t know what you’re complaining about, myself. Personally, I’d have welcomed a dementor attack. A deadly struggle for my soul would have broken the monotony nicely. You think you’ve had it bad, at least you’ve been able to get out and about, stretch your legs, get into a few fights. . . . I’ve been stuck inside for a month. Because the Ministry of Magic’s still after me, and Voldemort will know all about me being an Animagus by now, Wormtail will have told him, so my big disguise is useless. There’s not much I can do for the Order of the Phoenix . . . or so Dumbledore feels. Oh yeah, Listening to Snape’s reports, having to take all his snide hints that he’s out there risking his life while I’m sat on my backside here having a nice comfortable time . . . asking me how the cleaning’s going — Trying to make this place fit for human habitation, No one’s lived here for ten years, not since my dear mother died, unless you count her old house-elf, and he’s gone round the twist, hasn’t cleaned anything in ages — Yes, Finest fifteenth-century goblin-wrought silver, embossed with the Black family crest. Whatever you like, I look forward to it, Molly doesn’t approve of Mundungus, He’s useful, Knows all the crooks — well, he would, seeing as he’s one himself. But he’s also very loyal to Dumbledore, who helped him out of a tight spot once. It pays to have someone like Dung around, he hears things we don’t. But Molly thinks inviting him to stay for dinner is going too far. She hasn’t forgiven him for slipping off duty when he was supposed to be tailing you. Not just yet, Molly, You know, I’m surprised at you. I thought the first thing you’d do when you got here would be to start asking questions about Voldemort. “Since when did someone have to be in the Order of the Phoenix to ask questions?” “Harry’s been trapped in that Muggle house for a month. He’s got the right to know what’s been happen —” It’s not my fault you haven’t been told what the Order’s doing, That’s your parents’ decision. Harry, on the other hand — Which bit? He’s not a child! I’m perfectly clear who he is, thanks, Molly, Meaning I’m an irresponsible godfather? We’ll leave my instructions from Dumbledore out of this, if you please! He’s not your son, He’s got me! What? That’s because there haven’t been any suspicious deaths yet, not as far as we know, anyway. . . . And we know quite a lot. Because he doesn’t want to draw attention to himself at the moment, It would be dangerous for him. His comeback didn’t come off quite the way he wanted it to, you see. He messed it up. You weren’t supposed to survive! Nobody apart from his Death Eaters was supposed to know he’d come back. But you survived to bear witness. Thanks to you, Dumbledore was able to recall the Order of the Phoenix about an hour after Voldemort returned, Working as hard as we can to make sure Voldemort can’t carry out his plans, Well, firstly, he wants to build up his army again, In the old days he had huge numbers at his command; witches and wizards he’d bullied or bewitched into following him, his faithful Death Eaters, a great variety of Dark creatures. You heard him planning to recruit the giants; well, they’ll be just one group he’s after. He’s certainly not going to try and take on the Ministry of Magic with only a dozen Death Eaters. Because accepting that Voldemort’s back would mean trouble like the Ministry hasn’t had to cope with for nearly fourteen years, Fudge just can’t bring himself to face it. It’s so much more comfortable to convince himself Dumbledore’s lying to destabilize him. Well, as everyone thinks I’m a mad mass murderer and the Ministry’s put a ten-thousand-Galleon price on my head, I can hardly stroll up the street and start handing out leaflets, can I? Tonks and Arthur would lose their jobs at the Ministry if they started shooting their mouths off, and it’s very important for us to have spies inside the Ministry, because you can bet Voldemort will have them. Who said none of us was putting the news out? Why d’you think Dumbledore’s in such trouble? Voldemort doesn’t march up to people’s houses and bang on their front doors, Harry, He tricks, jinxes, and blackmails them. He’s well-practiced at operating in secrecy. Yes. Anyway . . . I’ve just been feeding Buckbeak, I keep him upstairs in my mother’s bedroom. Anyway . . . this writing desk . . . Well, Molly, I’m pretty sure this is a boggart, but perhaps we ought to let Mad-Eye have a shifty at it before we let it out — knowing my mother it could be something much worse. “I keep telling them not to ring the doorbell!” A likely story, Stand up straight, Now, what are you up to? — and it’s getting blacker every day, it’s filthy, Kreacher, She kept herself alive out of pure spite. I asked you what you were up to, Every time you show up pretending to be cleaning, you sneak something off to your room so we can’t throw it out. I thought it might be that, She’ll have put another Permanent Sticking Charm on the back of it, I don’t doubt, but if I can get rid of it I certainly will. Now go away, Kreacher. Keep muttering and I will be a murderer! He’s been alone too long, taking mad orders from my mother’s portrait and talking to himself, but he was always a foul little — We can’t set him free, he knows too much about the Order, And anyway, the shock would kill him. You suggest to him that he leaves this house, see how he takes it. I used to be there, My sweet old mother blasted me off after I ran away from home — Kreacher’s quite fond of muttering the story under his breath. When I was about sixteen, I’d had enough. Your dad’s place, Your grandparents were really good about it; they sort of adopted me as a second son. Leave? Because I hated the whole lot of them: my parents, with their pure-blood mania, convinced that to be a Black made you practically royal . . . my idiot brother, soft enough to believe them . . . that’s him. He was younger than me, and a much better son, as I was constantly reminded. Yeah, Stupid idiot . . . he joined the Death Eaters. Come on, Harry, haven’t you seen enough of this house to tell what kind of wizards my family were? No, no, but believe me, they thought Voldemort had the right idea, they were all for the purification of the Wizarding race, getting rid of Muggle-borns and having purebloods in charge. They weren’t alone either, there were quite a few people, before Voldemort showed his true colors, who thought he had the right idea about things. . . . They got cold feet when they saw what he was prepared to do to get power, though. But I bet my parents thought Regulus was a right little hero for joining up at first. Oh no, No, he was murdered by Voldemort. From what I found out after he died, he got in so far, then panicked about what he was being asked to do and tried to back out. Well, you don’t just hand in your resignation to Voldemort. It’s a lifetime of service or death. I haven’t looked at this for years. There’s Phineas Nigellus . . . my great-great-grandfather, see? Least popular headmaster Hogwarts ever had . . . and Araminta Meliflua . . . tried to force through a Ministry Bill to make Muggle-hunting legal . . . and dear Aunt Elladora . . . she started the family tradition of beheading house-elves when they got too old to carry tea trays . . . of course, anytime the family produced someone halfway decent they were disowned. I see Tonks isn’t on here.  Maybe that’s why Kreacher won’t take orders from her — he’s supposed to do whatever anyone in the family asks him . . . Yeah, No, Andromeda’s not on here either, look — Andromeda’s sisters are still here because they made lovely, respectable pure-blood marriages, but Andromeda married a Muggle-born, Ted Tonks, so — The pure-blood families are all interrelated, Molly and I are cousins by marriage and Arthur’s something like my second cousin once removed. But there’s no point looking for them on here — if ever a family was a bunch of blood traitors it’s the Weasleys. They’re in Azkaban, Bellatrix and her husband Rodolphus came in with Barty Crouch, Junior, Rodolphus’s brother, Rabastan, was with them too. Does it matter if she’s my cousin? As far as I’m concerned, they’re not my family. She’s certainly not my family. I haven’t seen her since I was your age, unless you count a glimpse of her coming in to Azkaban. D’you think I’m proud of having relatives like her? It doesn’t matter, I don’t like being back here, I never thought I’d be stuck in this house again. It’s ideal for headquarters, of course, My father put every security measure known to Wizard-kind on it when he lived here. It’s Unplottable, so Muggles could never come and call — as if they’d have wanted to — and now Dumbledore’s added his protection, you’d be hard put to find a safer house anywhere. Dumbledore’s Secret-Keeper for the Order, you know — nobody can find headquarters unless he tells them personally where it is — that note Moody showed you last night, that was from Dumbledore . . . If my parents could see the use it was being put to now . . . well, my mother’s portrait should give you some idea . . . I wouldn’t mind if I could just get out occasionally and do something useful. I’ve asked Dumbledore whether I can escort you to your hearing — as Snuffles, obviously — so I can give you a bit of moral support, what d’you think? Don’t worry, I’m sure they’re going to clear you, there’s definitely something in the International Statute of Secrecy about being allowed to use magic to save your own life. We’ll see. They must be bad if you prefer this place, “— think he’s quite right,” Don’t lose your temper, Be polite and stick to the facts. And if it’s not, I’ll see to Amelia Bones for you . . . What Absolutely, We’ll tell him, don’t worry. Well, I’d better get going, there’s a vomiting toilet in Bethnal Green waiting for me. Molly, I’ll be late, I’m covering for Tonks, but Kingsley might be dropping in for dinner — What’s that you’ve got there, Mad-Eye? Don’t worry about Percy, He’ll come round. It’s a matter of time before Voldemort moves into the open; once he does, the whole Ministry’s going to be begging us to forgive them. And I’m not sure I’ll be accepting their apology, I was starting to think you’d go to bed before everyone else had disappeared, I’ve been checking every hour. Just for a few seconds to check if the coast was clear yet. Yeah, Harry  This was the only way I could come up with of answering Harry’s letter without resorting to a code — and codes are breakable. No, it was very good, Anyway, we’d better be quick, just in case we’re disturbed — your scar. All right, It kept aching all last year, didn’t it? Yeah, Yes, but the world isn’t split into good people and Death Eaters, I know she’s a nasty piece of work, though — you should hear Remus talk about her. No, but she drafted a bit of anti-werewolf legislation two years ago that makes it almost impossible for him to get a job. Scared of them, I expect, Apparently she loathes part-humans; she campaigned to have merpeople rounded up and tagged last year too. Imagine wasting your time and energy persecuting merpeople when there are little toerags like Kreacher on the loose — So what are Umbridge’s lessons like? Is she training you all to kill half-breeds? Ah, well, that figures, Our information from inside the Ministry is that Fudge doesn’t want you trained in combat. That’s exactly what he thinks you’re doing, or rather, that’s exactly what he’s afraid Dumbledore’s doing — forming his own private army, with which he will be able to take on the Ministry of Magic. Yeah, Fudge thinks Dumbledore will stop at nothing to seize power. He’s getting more paranoid about Dumbledore by the day. It’s a matter of time before he has Dumbledore arrested on some trumped-up charge. I don’t know, I haven’t seen anyone from the Order all weekend, they’re all busy. It’s just been Kreacher and me here . . . Ah . . . well, he was supposed to be back by now, no one’s sure what’s happened to him. But Dumbledore’s not worried, so don’t you three get yourselves in a state; I’m sure Hagrid’s fine. Listen, don’t go asking too many questions about Hagrid, I was thinking, we got away with the dog disguise at the station, didn’t we? I thought I could — Oh that, they’re always guessing where I am, they haven’t really got a clue — All right, Just an idea, thought you might like to get together — You’re less like your father than I thought, The risk would’ve been what made it fun for James. Hi, How’re things? — or secret Defense Against the Dark Arts groups? You want to choose your meeting places more carefully, The Hog’s Head, I ask you . . . — which means you’d have been harder to overhear, You’ve got a lot to learn, Hermione. Mundungus, of course, He was the witch under the veil. What? Keeping an eye on you, of course. Yes, He was banned from the Hog’s Head twenty years ago, said Sirius, and that barman’s got a long memory. We lost Moody’s spare Invisibility Cloak when Sturgis was arrested, so Dung’s been dressing as a witch a lot lately. . . . Anyway . . . First of all, Ron — I’ve sworn to pass on a message from your mother. She says on no account whatsoever are you to take part in an illegal secret Defense Against the Dark Arts group. She says you’ll be expelled for sure and your future will be ruined. She says there will be plenty of time to learn how to defend yourself later and that you are too young to be worrying about that right now. She also advises Harry and Hermione not to proceed with the group, though she accepts that she has no authority over either of them and simply begs them to remember that she has their best interests at heart. She would have written all this to you, but if the owl had been intercepted you’d all have been in real trouble, and she can’t say it for herself because she’s on duty tonight. Never you mind, just stuff for the Order, said Sirius. So it’s fallen to me to be the messenger and make sure you tell her I passed it all on, because I don’t think she trusts me to. Me? Certainly not! I think it’s an excellent idea! Of course I do! D’you think your father and I would’ve lain down and taken orders from an old hag like Umbridge? Harry! This year we know that there’s someone outside Hogwarts who’d like to kill us all, so I think learning to defend yourselves properly is a very good idea! Well, better expelled and able to defend yourselves than sitting safely in school without a clue, So, said Sirius, how are you organizing this group? Where are you meeting? How about the Shrieking Shack? “Oh …” “Well, I’ll have a think and get back to —” What’s going on? She probably doesn’t even know what’s happened yet, The important thing was to get you away before Umbridge could interfere. I expect Dumbledore’s letting Molly know now. Hang on, you can’t go tearing off to St. Mungo’s! And how are you going to explain how you knew Arthur was attacked before the hospital even let his wife know? It matters because we don’t want to draw attention to the fact that Harry is having visions of things that are happening hundreds of miles away! Have you any idea what the Ministry would make of that information? Like who? Listen, your dad’s been hurt while on duty for the Order and the circumstances are fishy enough without his children knowing about it seconds after it happened, you could seriously damage the Order’s — Your father knew what he was getting into, and he won’t thank you for messing things up for the Order! This is how it is — this is why you’re not in the Order — you don’t understand — there are things worth dying for! I know it’s hard, but we’ve all got to act as though we don’t know anything yet. We’ve got to stay put, at least until we hear from your mother, all right? That’s right, come on, let’s all . . . let’s all have a drink while we’re waiting. Accio Butterbeer! Did you tell Dumbledore this? I’m sure he would have told you if it was anything to worry about, It must have been the aftermath of the vision, that’s all, You were still thinking of the dream or whatever it was and — You need to sleep, You’re going to have breakfast and then go upstairs to bed, and then you can go and see Arthur after lunch with the others. You’re in shock, Harry; you’re blaming yourself for something you only witnessed, and it’s lucky you did witness it or Arthur might have died. Just stop worrying . . . God Rest Ye Merry, Hippogriffs Come to think of it, has anyone actually seen Kreacher lately? Yeah . . . You know, I think that’s the last time I saw him, too. . . . He must be hiding upstairs somewhere . . . No, no, house-elves can’t leave unless they’re given clothes, they’re tied to their family’s house, You know, I think I’d prefer it if you didn’t give orders here, Snape. It’s my house, you see. I’m his godfather, What’s that supposed to mean? Why can’t Dumbledore teach Harry? Why you? Wait a moment, I’ll get to the point, then, If I hear you’re using these Occlumency lessons to give Harry a hard time, you’ll have me to answer to. Yes, I have, I’ve warned you, Snivellus, I don’t care if Dumbledore thinks you’ve reformed, I know better — Tell me, how is Lucius Malfoy these days? I expect he’s delighted his lapdog’s working at Hogwarts, isn’t he? Are you calling me a coward? Harry — get — out — of — it! I want you to take this, A way of letting me know if Snape’s giving you a hard time. No, don’t open it in here! I doubt Molly would approve — but I want you to use it if you need me, all right? Let’s go, then, Look after yourself, Harry, What is it? Are you all right? Do you need help? Look, Harry, James and Snape hated each other from the moment they set eyes on each other, it was just one of those things, you can understand that, can’t you? I think James was everything Snape wanted to be — he was popular, he was good at Quidditch, good at pretty much everything. And Snape was just this little oddball who was up to his eyes in the Dark Arts and James — whatever else he may have appeared to you, Harry — always hated the Dark Arts. I’m not proud of it, If we were sometimes arrogant little berks, you mean, I’d forgotten he used to do that, We were all idiots! Well — not Moony so much, Yes, you made us feel ashamed of ourselves sometimes. . . . That was something . . . Oh, well, he always made a fool of himself whenever Lily was around, He couldn’t stop himself showing off whenever he got near her. No, Once James had deflated his head a bit, She didn’t know too much about it, to tell you the truth, I mean, James didn’t take Snape on dates with her and jinx him in front of her, did he? Look, your father was the best friend I ever had, and he was a good person. A lot of people are idiots at the age of fifteen. He grew out of it. What?  No, It must be somebody your end . . . “You’ll have to kill me,” Nice one! Harry, “Come on, you can do better than that!” Use it if you need me, all right? Dying? Not at all, Quicker and easier than falling asleep. We are part of you, Invisible to anyone else.",

She’ll wander back into the office sometime in October, thinking it’s still July. but we really can’t spare anyone at the moment. Oh — talk of the devil! Barty! Pull up a bit of grass, Barty, Oh is that what they’re after? I thought the chap was asking to borrow a pair of tweezers. Bit of a strong accent. Well, they’ll never replace brooms in Britain, will they? So, been keeping busy, Barty? Glad! Don’t know when I’ve had more fun. . . .

Gentlemen . . . lady, May I introduce — incredible though it may seem — the fourth Triwizard champion? Joke? Well . . . it is amazing, But, as you know, the age restriction was only imposed this year as an extra safety measure. And as his name’s come out of the goblet . . . I mean, I don’t think there can be any ducking out at this stage. . . . It’s down in the rules, you’re obliged . . . Harry will just have to do the best he — We must follow the rules, and the rules state clearly that those people whose names come out of the Goblet of Fire are bound to compete in the tournament. Well, Barty knows the rule book back to front, But Karkaroff, it doesn’t work like that, Moody, old man . . . what a thing to say! Well, shall we crack on, then? Got to give our champions their instructions, haven’t we? Barty, want to do the honors? Ah, here he is! Champion number four! In you come, Harry, in you come . . . nothing to worry about, it’s just the wand weighing ceremony, the rest of the judges will be here in a moment — We have to check that your wands are fully functional, no problems, you know, as they’re your most important tools in the tasks ahead, The expert’s upstairs now with Dumbledore. And then there’s going to be a little photo shoot. She’s doing a small piece on the tournament for the Daily Prophet. . . . Certainly! That is — if Harry has no objection? Harry! Good-o! Come in, come in, make yourself at home! Well, now we’re all here — time to fill you in! When the audience has assembled, I’m going to be offering each of you this bag from which you will each select a small model of the thing you are about to face! There are different — er — varieties, you see. And I have to tell you something else too . . . ah, yes . . . your task is to collect the golden egg! Ladies first, Well, there you are! You have each pulled out the dragon you will face, and the numbers refer to the order in which you are to take on the dragons, do you see? Now, I’m going to have to leave you in a moment, because I’m commentating. Mr. Diggory, you’re first, just go out into the enclosure when you hear a whistle, all right? Now . . . Harry . . . could I have a quick word? Outside? Feeling all right, Harry? Anything I can get you? Got a plan? Because I don’t mind sharing a few pointers, if you’d like them, you know. I mean, you’re the underdog here, Harry. . . . Anything I can do to help . . . Nobody would know, Harry, Good lord, I’ve got to run! Clever move — pity it didn’t work! Very good indeed! And now the marks from the judges! One down, three to go! Miss Delacour, if you please! Oh I’m not sure that was wise! Oh . . . nearly!  Careful now . . . good lord, I thought she’d had it then! And here comes Mr. Krum! Very daring! That’s some nerve he’s showing — and — yes, he’s got the egg! Great Scott, he can fly! Are you watching this, Mr. Krum? Look at that! Will you look at that! Our youngest champion is quickest to get his egg! Well, this is going to shorten the odds on Mr. Potter! “In a moment, in a moment!” Harry! Wonder if I could have a quick, private word, Harry? You couldn’t give us a moment, you two, could you? Well, I just thought I’d congratulate you again on your splendid performance against that Horntail, Harry, Really superb. Absolute nightmare, Their English isn’t too good . . . it’s like being back with all the Bulgarians at the Quidditch World Cup . . . but at least they used sign language another human could recognize. This lot keep gabbling in Gobbledegook . . . and I only know one word of Gobbledegook. Bladvak. It means ‘pickax. ’ I don’t like to use it in case they think I’m threatening them. Er — well . . . Er . . . as a matter of fact, I’ve no idea where he is, He’s sort of . . . stopped coming to work. Been absent for a couple of weeks now. Young Percy, his assistant, says he’s ill. Apparently he’s just been sending instructions in by owl. But would you mind not mentioning that to anyone, Harry? No, I haven’t, Well . . . well, yes, but — come on, Harry — we all want a Hogwarts victory, don’t we? No, I haven’t, I — well, like I say, I’ve taken a liking to you. Just thought I’d offer . . . Er . . . no, no, thank you, boys . . . Well, I must dash, Nice seeing you all. Good luck, Harry. Now, now, Percy! Let him catch his breath! All right, Harry? Know what you’re going to do? Sonorus! They have precisely an hour to recover what has been taken from them. On the count of three, then. One . . . two . . . three! two . . . Hello there! Well, what d’you think? Growing nicely, aren’t they? Give them a month and Hagrid’ll have them twenty feet high. Don’t worry, you’ll have your Quidditch field back to normal once the task is over! Now, I imagine you can guess what we’re making here? Maze, That’s right! The Triwizard Cup will be placed in the center of the maze. The first champion to touch it will receive full marks. Maze, Hagrid is providing a number of creatures . . . then there will be spells that must be broken . . . all that sort of thing, you know. Now, the champions who are leading on points will get a head start into the maze. Then Mr. Krum will enter . . . then Miss Delacour. But you’ll all be in with a fighting chance, depending how well you get past the obstacles. Should be fun, eh? Very well . . . if you haven’t got any questions, we’ll go back up to the castle, shall we,  it’s a bit chilly. I’ll wait for you, Harry, shall I? Feeling all right, Harry? Confident? Off you go, then! Sonorus, Ladies and gentlemen, the third and final task of the Triwizard Tournament is about to begin! Let me remind you how the points currently stand! So . . . on my whistle, Harry and Cedric!",

You have now come very close to accusing the two people in this clearing who are least likely to conjure that Mark! I suppose you are familiar with the boy’s story, Amos? And I trust you remember the many proofs I have given, over a long career, that I despise and detest the Dark Arts and those who practice them? If you accuse my elf, you accuse me, Diggory!

I ask you, however, to allow me to deal with her. You may rest assured that she will be punished, Winky has behaved tonight in a manner I would not have believed possible, I told her to remain in the tent. I told her to stay there while I went to sort out the trouble. And I find that she disobeyed me. This means clothes.

The person who conjured the Mark? Er — what? Well, it didn’t help us tonight, whoever conjured it. It scared the Death Eaters away the moment they saw it. They all Disapparated before we’d got near enough to unmask any of them. We caught the Robertses before they hit the ground, though. They’re having their memories modified right now. It’s what You-Know-Who’s supporters called themselves, I think we saw what’s left of them tonight — the ones who managed to keep themselves out of Azkaban, anyway. Use your brains, Ron, If they really were Death Eaters, they worked very hard to keep out of Azkaban when You-Know-Who lost power, and told all sorts of lies about him forcing them to kill and torture people. I bet they’d be even more frightened than the rest of us to see him come back. They denied they’d ever been involved with him when he lost his powers, and went back to their daily lives. . . . I don’t reckon he’d be over-pleased with them, do you? Do us a favor, Perce, and shut up. Did someone say Mad-Eye? What’s he been up to now? Moody was a great wizard in his time, Yeah, I sort of wish I were back at Hogwarts this year, You’re going to have an interesting year, I might even get time off to come and watch a bit of it. . . . You all right? Charlie wanted to come, but he couldn’t get time off. He said you were incredible against the Horntail. It’s great being back here, Haven’t seen this place for five years. Is that picture of the mad knight still around? Sir Cadogan? And the Fat Lady? What were you doing out of your dormitory at four in the morning? Fancy giving us a tour, Harry? Not good, Journey all right, Harry? Mad-Eye didn’t make you come via Greenland, then? Evanesco! Let’s eat, They’re not giving anything away yet, I still can’t work out whether they believe he’s back or not. ’Course, they might prefer not to take sides at all. Keep out of it. He’s feeling pretty anti-wizard at the moment, Are you kidding? Dumbledore was the only one You-Know-Who was ever scared of! Well, the main thing is to try and convince as many people as possible that You-Know-Who really has returned, to put them on their guard, It’s proving tricky, though. But Dumbledore says he doesn’t care what they do as long as they don’t take him off the Chocolate Frog cards, Did you hear about Florean Fortescue, Remus? Dragged off, by the look of his place. Who knows? He must’ve upset them somehow. He was a good man, Florean. That’s already Harry’s, idiot, I got it out of your vault for you, Harry, because it’s taking about five hours for the public to get to their gold at the moment, the goblins have tightened security so much. Two days ago Arkie Philpott had a Probity Probe stuck up his . . . Well, trust me, this way’s easier. I’m taking Fleur on a thestral, She’s not that fond of brooms. Here, Mad-Eye. Mad-Eye, Mad-Eye, I know what you’re thinking, and I wondered that too, on the way back here, because they seemed to be expecting us, didn’t they? But Mundungus can’t have betrayed us. I think Dung panicked, it’s as simple as that.  He didn’t want to come in the first place, but Mad-Eye made him, and You-Know-Who went straight for them. It was enough to make anyone panic. No, I’ll do it, I’ll come. Wait? Not unless you’d rather the Death Eaters took it? Nothing, The Daily Prophet hasn’t said a word about him dying or about finding the body, But that doesn’t mean much. It’s keeping a lot quiet these days. Ron’s taken her inside, She’ll be all right. . . . lucky that Ginny’s on holiday. If she’d been at Hogwarts, they could have taken her before we reached her. Now we know she’s safe too. I’ve been getting them all out of the Burrow, Moved them to Muriel’s. The Death Eaters know Ron’s with you now, they’re bound to target the family — don’t apologize, It was always a matter of time, Dad’s been saying so for months. We’re the biggest blood-traitor family there is. Fidelius Charm. Dad’s Secret-Keeper. And we’ve done it on this cottage too; I’m Secret-Keeper here. None of us can go to work, but that’s hardly the most important thing now. Once Ollivander and Griphook are well enough, we’ll move them to Muriel’s too. There isn’t much room here, but she’s got plenty. Griphook’s legs are on the mend, Fleur’s given him Skele-Gro; we could probably move them in an hour or — Harry, what the hell’s going on? You turn up here with a dead house-elf and a half-conscious goblin, Hermione looks as though she’s been tortured, and Ron’s just refused to tell me anything — Up here, then, In here, Harry, what the hell’s going on? And paid for by wizards, Everything’s fine, Ollivander settled in, Mum and Dad say hello. Ginny sends you all her love. Fred and George are driving Muriel up the wall, they’re still operating an Owl-Order business out of her back room. It cheered her up to have her tiara back, though. She said she thought we’d stolen it. Who is it? Lupin, Godfather, Harry! A real honor! Congratulations! I wanted a private word, actually, Harry. It hasn’t been easy to get an opportunity with the cottage this full of people. Harry, you’re planning something with Griphook. I know goblins, I’ve worked for Gringotts ever since I left Hogwarts. As far as there can be friendship between wizards and goblins, I have goblin friends — or, at least, goblins I know well, and like. Harry, what do you want from Griphook, and what have you promised him in return? Wait, Just a moment. Then I have to say this, Goblin notions of ownership, payment, and repayment are not the same as human ones. We are talking about a different breed of being, Dealings between wizards and goblins have been fraught for centuries — but you’ll know all that from History of Magic. There has been fault on both sides, I would never claim that wizards have been innocent. You don’t understand, Harry, nobody could understand unless they have lived with goblins. To a goblin, the rightful and true master of any object is the maker, not the purchaser. All goblin-made objects are, in goblin eyes, rightfully theirs. — then they would consider it rented by the one who had paid the money. They have, however, great difficulty with the idea of goblin-made objects passing from wizard to wizard. You saw Griphook’s face when the tiara passed under his eyes. He disapproves. I believe he thinks, as do the fiercest of his kind, that it ought to have been returned to the goblins once the original purchaser died. They consider our habit of keeping goblin-made objects, passing them from wizard to wizard without further payment, little more than theft. All I am saying, is to be very careful what you promise goblins, Harry. It would be less dangerous to break into Gringotts than to renege on a promise to a goblin. Mum’s right, Ginny, You can’t do this. Everyone underage will have to leave, it’s only right.",

Never — do — that — again — Hello, Professor McGonagall, Teaching, Yep, He might’ve mentioned it, yeah, I’ll do that, then, Oh yeah? Well, I know your father of old, boy. . . . You tell him Moody’s keeping a close eye on his son . . . you tell him that from me. . . . Now, your Head of House’ll be Snape, will it? Another old friend, I’ve been looking forward to a chat with old Snape. . . . Come on, you. . . . You can put those away, those books. Right then, I’ve had a letter from Professor Lupin about this class. Seems you’ve had a pretty thorough grounding in tackling Dark creatures — you’ve covered boggarts, Red Caps, hinkypunks, grindylows, Kappas, and werewolves, is that right? But you’re behind — very behind — on dealing with curses, So I’m here to bring you up to scratch on what wizards can do to each other. I’ve got one year to teach you how to deal with Dark — Yeah, Your father got me out of a very tight corner a few days ago. . . . Yeah, I’m staying just the one year. Special favor to Dumbledore. . . . One year, and then back to my quiet retirement. So — straight into it. Curses. They come in many strengths and forms. But Professor Dumbledore’s got a higher opinion of your nerves, he reckons you can cope, and I say, the sooner you know what you’re up against, the better. How are you supposed to defend yourself against something you’ve never seen? A wizard who’s about to put an illegal curse on you isn’t going to tell you what he’s about to do. He’s not going to do it nice and polite to your face. You need to be prepared. You need to be alert and watchful. You need to put that away, Miss Brown, when I’m talking. So . . . do any of you know which curses are most heavily punished by Wizarding law? Ah, yes, Your father would know that one. Gave the Ministry a lot of trouble at one time, the Imperius Curse. Imperio! Think it’s funny, do you? You’d like it, would you, if I did it to you? Total control, I could make it jump out of the window, drown itself, throw itself down one of your throats . . . Years back, there were a lot of witches and wizards being controlled by the Imperius Curse, The Imperius Curse can be fought, and I’ll be teaching you how, but it takes real strength of character, and not everyone’s got it. Better avoid being hit with it if you can. CONSTANT VIGILANCE! Anyone else know one? Another illegal curse? Yes? Your name’s Longbottom? The Cruciatus Curse, Needs to be a bit bigger for you to get the idea, Engorgio! Crucio! Reducio, Pain, You don’t need thumbscrews or knives to torture someone if you can perform the Cruciatus Curse. . . . That one was very popular once too. Anyone else know one? Yes? Ah, yes, Yes, the last and worst. Avada Kedavra . . . the Killing Curse. Avada Kedavra! Not nice, Not pleasant. And there’s no countercurse. There’s no blocking it. Only one known person has ever survived it, and he’s sitting right in front of me. But that doesn’t matter. I’m not here to teach you how to do it. CONSTANT VIGILANCE! Because you’ve got to know. You’ve got to appreciate what the worst is. You don’t want to find yourself in a situation where you’re facing it. CONSTANT VIGILANCE! Now . . . those three curses — Avada Kedavra, Imperius, and Cruciatus — are known as the Unforgivable Curses. The use of any one of them on a fellow human being is enough to earn a life sentence in Azkaban. That’s what you’re up against. That’s what I’ve got to teach you to fight. You need preparing. You need arming. But most of all, you need to practice constant, never-ceasing vigilance. Get out your quills . . . copy this down. . . . Neville, what — ? It’s all right, sonny, Why don’t you come up to my office? Come on . . . we can have a cup of tea. . . . You all right, are you, Potter? You’ve got to know. It seems harsh, maybe, but you’ve got to know.  No point pretending . . . well . . . come on, Longbottom, I’ve got some books that might interest you. Dumbledore wants you taught what it feels like, If you’d rather learn the hard way — when someone’s putting it on you so they can control you completely — fine by me. You’re excused. Off you go. Potter, you next. Imperio! Now, that’s more like it! Potter, He fought it, and he damn near beat it! We’ll try that again, Potter, and the rest of you, pay attention — watch his eyes, that’s where you see it — very good, Potter, very good indeed! They’ll have trouble controlling you! You can’t leave your champion now. He’s got to compete. They’ve all got to compete. Binding magical contract, like Dumbledore said. Convenient, eh? Don’t you? It’s very simple, Karkaroff. Someone put Potter’s name in that goblet knowing he’d have to compete if it came out. If anyone’s got reason to complain, it’s Potter, but . . . funny thing . . . I don’t hear him saying a word. . . . Maybe someone’s hoping Potter is going to die for it, Imagining things, am I? Seeing things, eh? It was a skilled witch or wizard who put the boy’s name in that goblet. . . . Because they hoodwinked a very powerful magical object! It would have needed an exceptionally strong Confundus Charm to bamboozle that goblet into forgetting that only three schools compete in the tournament. . . . I’m guessing they submitted Potter’s name under a fourth school, to make sure he was the only one in his category. . . . There are those who’ll turn innocent occasions to their advantage, It’s my job to think the way Dark wizards do, Karkaroff — as you ought to remember. . . . Nice Cloak, Potter. Yeah, it can see through Invisibility Cloaks, And it’s come in useful at times, I can tell you. Come with me, Potter, Diggory, off you go. Never mind that, Potter. In my office, please. . . . Nice and easy does the trick, Potter, Nice socks, Potter, Did I hear that correctly, Snape? Someone broke into your office? On the contrary, it is very important. Who’d want to break into your office? Reckon they were after potion ingredients, eh? Not hiding anything else in your office, are you? Auror’s privilege, Snape. Dumbledore told me to keep an eye — ’Course Dumbledore trusts you, He’s a trusting man, isn’t he? Believes in second chances. But me — I say there are spots that don’t come off, Snape. Spots that never come off, d’you know what I mean? Get back to bed, Snape. Prowl away, I look forward to meeting you in a dark corridor some time. . . . You’ve dropped something, by the way. . . . My mistake, What’s that? There’s nothing there, Snape! Meaning that Dumbledore’s very interested to know who’s got it in for that boy! And so am I, Snape . . . very interested. . . . Ah, I see, Got Potter’s best interests at heart, have you? Best idea you’ve had all night, Now, Filch, if you’ll just give me that egg — It’s the property of the champion he stole it from, Hand it over, now. Potter, What is this thing? Potter! This . . . this is some map, Potter! What? Oh! Yes . . . yes, of course . . . Potter . . . you didn’t happen, by any chance, to see who broke into Snape’s office, did you? On this map, I mean? Crouch? You’re — you’re sure, Potter? Well, he’s not here anymore, Crouch . . . that’s very — very interesting. . . . Put it this way, Potter, What? Potter, Crouch could be thinking along those lines, It’s making a lot of people nervous, I reckon. Oh if there’s one thing I hate, it’s a Death Eater who walked free. . . . Potter, Can I borrow this? Good boy, I can make good use of this . . . this might be exactly what I’ve been looking for. . . . Right, bed, Potter, come on, now. . . . You ever thought of a career as an Auror, Potter? You want to consider it, Yes, indeed . . . and incidentally . . . I’m guessing you weren’t just taking that egg for a walk tonight? Potter . . . No need, Dumbledore, I’m here. What? Would’ve been here quicker . . . what’s happened? Snape said something about Crouch — I’m onto it, Hello, Potter, Come in here. No Of course, Took a leaf out of your book, Potter. Summoned it from my office into the forest. He wasn’t anywhere on there. You’re another one who might think about a career as an Auror, he told her. Mind works the right way, Granger. We can’t rule out kidnap, Could be anywhere, Only thing we know for sure is that he’s not here. Now, Dumbledore’s told me you three fancy yourselves as investigators, but there’s nothing you can do for Crouch. The Ministry’ll be looking for him now, Dumbledore’s notified them. Potter, you just keep your mind on the third task. Should be right up your street, this one, From what Dumbledore’s said, you’ve managed to get through stuff like this plenty of times. Broke your way through a series of obstacles guarding the Sorcerer’s Stone in your first year, didn’t you? In the meantime . . . constant vigilance, Potter. Constant vigilance. You two, you stick close to Potter, all right?   I’m keeping an eye on things, but all the same . . . you can never have too many eyes out. Hello, Potter, Come in, then. It’s all right, son, I’ve got you . . . come on . . . hospital wing . . . You need to lie down. . . . Come on now. . . . What happened, Harry? The Dark Lord was there? What happened then? And then? The Dark Lord got his body back? He’s returned? You dueled with the Dark Lord? In here, Harry . . . in here, and sit down. . . . You’ll be all right now . . . drink this. . . . Drink it . . . you’ll feel better . . . come on, now, Harry, I need to know exactly what happened. . . . Voldemort’s back, Harry? You’re sure he’s back? How did he do it? What did the Dark Lord take from you? And the Death Eaters? They returned? How did he treat them? Did he forgive them? I know who the Death Eater is, Karkaroff? Karkaroff fled tonight, when he felt the Dark Mark burn upon his arm. He betrayed too many faithful supporters of the Dark Lord to wish to meet them . . . but I doubt he will get far. The Dark Lord has ways of tracking his enemies. No, No, he didn’t. It was I who did that. I assure you I did, He forgave them, then? he said. The Death Eaters who went free? The ones who escaped Azkaban? I asked you, whether he forgave the scum who never even went to look for him. Those treacherous cowards who wouldn’t even brave Azkaban for him. I told you, Harry . . . I told you. If there’s one thing I hate more than any other, it’s a Death Eater who walked free. They turned their backs on my master when he needed them most. I expected him to punish them. I expected him to torture them. Tell me he hurt them, Harry. . . . Tell me he told them that I, I alone remained faithful . . . prepared to risk everything to deliver to him the one thing he wanted above all . . . you. Who put your name in the Goblet of Fire, under the name of a different school? It hasn’t been easy, Harry, guiding you through these tasks without arousing suspicion. I have had to use every ounce of cunning I possess, so that my hand would not be detectable in your success. Dumbledore would have been very suspicious if you had managed everything too easily. As long as you got into that maze, preferably with a decent head start — then, I knew, I would have a chance of getting rid of the other champions and leaving your way clear. But I also had to contend with your stupidity. The second task . . . that was when I was most afraid we would fail. I was keeping watch on you, Potter. I knew you hadn’t worked out the egg’s clue, so I had to give you another hint — Who told Cedric to open it underwater? Decent people are so easy to manipulate, Potter. I was sure Cedric would want to repay you for telling him about the dragons, and so he did. But even then, Potter, even then you seemed likely to fail. I was watching all the time . . . all those hours in the library. Didn’t you realize that the book you needed was in your dormitory all along? I planted it there early on, I gave it to the Longbottom boy, don’t you remember? Magical Water Plants of the Mediterranean. It would have told you all you needed to know about gillyweed. I expected you to ask everyone and anyone you could for help. Longbottom would have told you in an instant. But you did not . . . you did not. . . . You have a streak of pride and independence that might have ruined all. So what could I do? Feed you information from another innocent source. You told me at the Yule Ball a house-elf called Dobby had given you a Christmas present. I called the elf to the staffroom to collect some robes for cleaning. I staged a loud conversation with Professor McGonagall about the hostages who had been taken, and whether Potter would think to use gillyweed. And your little elf friend ran straight to Snape’s office and then hurried to find you. . . . But luckily, Dumbledore took your idiocy for nobility, and marked you high for it. I breathed again. You had an easier time of it than you should have in that maze tonight, of course, I was patrolling around it, able to see through the outer hedges, able to curse many obstacles out of your way. Imagine how he will reward me when he finds I have done it for him. I gave you to him — the thing he needed above all to regenerate — and then I killed you for him.  I will be honored beyond all other Death Eaters. I will be his dearest, his closest supporter . . . closer than a son. . . . The Dark Lord and I, have much in common.  oth of us, for instance, had very disappointing fathers . . . very disappointing indeed. Both of us suffered the indignity, Harry, of being named after those fathers. And both of us had the pleasure . . . the very great pleasure . . . of killing our fathers to ensure the continued rise of the Dark Order! Mad, am I? We’ll see! I’m all right, Just tired. Lower your wand, boy, before you take someone’s eye out, I don’t know so much about ‘Professor,’ Get down here, we want to see you properly. It’d be a nice lookout if we bring back some Death Eater impersonating him. We ought to ask him something only the real Potter would know. Elementary wand safety, nobody bothers about it anymore . . . Yeah, well, the more the better, We’re your guard, Potter. Get me a glass of water, would you, Harry?  Cheers, Come here, boy, I need to Disillusion you. Disillusionment Charm, Lupin says you’ve got an Invisibility Cloak, but it won’t stay on while we’re flying; this’ll disguise you better. Here you go — Get going, then, Got it, Borrowed it from Dumbledore, That’ll take care of any Muggles looking out of the window, see? Now, come on, quick. Here, Read quickly and memorize. Not here, boy! Wait till we’re inside! Come on, hurry, You all right, Potter? Come here, I’ve got something that might interest you, Original Order of the Phoenix, Found it last night when I was looking for my spare Invisibility Cloak, seeing as Podmore hasn’t had the manners to return my best one. . . . Thought people might like to see it. There’s me, And there’s Dumbledore beside me, Dedalus Diggle on the other side . . . That’s Marlene McKinnon, she was killed two weeks after this was taken, they got her whole family. That’s Frank and Alice Longbottom — Poor devils, Better dead than what happened to them . . . and that’s Emmeline Vance, you’ve met her, and that there’s Lupin, obviously . . . Benjy Fenwick, he copped it too, we only ever found bits of him . . . shift aside there, That’s Edgar Bones . . . brother of Amelia Bones, they got him and his family too, he was a great wizard . . . Sturgis Podmore, blimey, he looks young . . . Caradoc Dearborn, vanished six months after this, we never found his body . . . Hagrid, of course, looks exactly the same as ever . . . Elphias Doge, you’ve met him, I’d forgotten he used to wear that stupid hat . . . Gideon Prewett, it took five Death Eaters to kill him and his brother Fabian, they fought like heroes . . . budge along, budge along . . . That’s Dumbledore’s brother, Aberforth, only time I ever met him, strange bloke . . . That’s Dorcas Meadowes, Voldemort killed her personally . . . Sirius, when he still had short hair . . . and . . . there you go, thought that would interest you! Eh? All okay, Don’t think we were followed . . . No trouble? I’ll still be reporting Sturgis to Dumbledore, That’s the second time he’s not turned up in a week. Getting as unreliable as Mundungus. Yeah, keep your head down and your eyes peeled, And don’t forget, all of you — careful what you put in writing. If in doubt, don’t put it in a letter at all. Well, That’ll be them, will it, Potter? Yes, Change of plan, Let’s get undercover before we talk you through it. All right, all right, we’ll have time for a cozy catch-up later! As Dedalus probably told you, we had to abandon Plan A. Pius Thicknesse has gone over, which gives us a big problem. All done in the name of your protection, to prevent You-Know-Who getting in at you. Absolutely pointless, seeing as your mother’s charm does that already. What he’s really done is to stop you getting out of here safely. Second problem: You’re underage, which means you’ve still got the Trace on you. The Trace, the Trace! The charm that detects magical activity around under-seventeens, the way the Ministry finds out about underage magic! If you, or anyone around you, casts a spell to get you out of here, Thicknesse is going to know about it, and so will the Death Eaters. We can’t wait for the Trace to break, because the moment you turn seventeen you’ll lose all the protection your mother gave you. In short: Pius Thicknesse thinks he’s got you cornered good and proper. Now, your mother’s charm will only break under two conditions: when you come of age, or you no longer call this place home. You and your aunt and uncle are going your separate ways tonight, in the full understanding that you’re never going to live together again, correct? So this time, when you leave, there’ll be no going back, and the charm will break the moment you get outside its range. We’re choosing to break it early, because the alternative is waiting for You-Know-Who to come and seize you the moment you turn seventeen. The one thing we’ve got on our side is that You-Know-Who doesn’t know we’re moving you tonight. We’ve leaked a fake trail to the Ministry: They think you’re not leaving until the thirtieth. However, this is You-Know-Who we’re dealing with, so we can’t just rely on him getting the date wrong; So, we’ve given a dozen different houses every protection we can throw at them. You’ll be going to Tonks’s parents. Once you’re within the boundaries of the protective enchantments we’ve put on their house, you’ll be able to use a Portkey to the Burrow. Any questions? Ah, I forgot to mention the key point. Fourteen of us won’t be flying to Tonks’s parents’. There will be seven Harry Potters moving through the skies tonight, each of them with a companion, each pair heading for a different safe house. If it has to come to force, then it will, Everyone here’s overage, Potter, and they’re all prepared to take the risk. Let’s have no more arguments.Time’s wearing on.  I want a few of your hairs, boy, now. Now! barked Moody. Good, Straight in here, if you please. Right then, fake Potters line up over here, please, Shut it, As I’ve already told you, you spineless worm, any Death Eaters we run into will be aiming to capture Potter, not kill him. Dumbledore always said You-Know-Who would want to finish Potter in person. It’ll be the protectors who have got the most to worry about, the Death Eaters’ll want to kill them. Altogether, then . . . Those whose clothes are a bit roomy, I’ve got smaller here, and vice versa. Don’t forget the glasses, there’s six pairs in the side pocket. And when you’re dressed, there’s luggage in the other sack. Good, The pairs will be as follows: Mundungus will be traveling with me, by broom — Because you’re the one that needs watching, Sorry, George — Miss Granger with Kingsley, again by thestral — We think the Death Eaters will expect you to be on a broom, Snape’s had plenty of time to tell them everything about you he’s never mentioned before, so if we do run into any Death Eaters, we’re betting they’ll choose one of the Potters who look at home on a broomstick. All right then, I make it three minutes until we’re supposed to leave. No point locking the back door, it won’t keep the Death Eaters out when they come looking. . . . Come on. . . . All right then, Everyone ready, please; I want us all to leave at exactly the same time or the whole point of the diversion’s lost.",

Knew you had it in you! I’d rather like to know that myself, Dumbledore, Two Hogwarts champions? I don’t remember anyone telling me the host school is allowed two champions — or have I not read the rules carefully enough? We were under the impression that your Age Line would keep out younger contestants, Dumbledore, Otherwise, we would, of course, have brought along a wider selection of candidates from our own schools. Mr. Crouch . . . Mr. Bagman, you are our — er — objective judges. Surely you will agree that this is most irregular? I insist upon resubmitting the names of the rest of my students, You will set up the Goblet of Fire once more, and we will continue adding names until each school has two champions. It’s only fair, Dumbledore. — in which Durmstrang will most certainly not be competing! After all our meetings and negotiations and compromises, I little expected something of this nature to occur! I have half a mind to leave now! Convenient? I’m afraid I don’t understand you, Moody. I quite agree, Madame Maxime, We all know Professor Moody considers the morning wasted if he hasn’t discovered six plots to murder him before lunchtime, Apparently he is now teaching his students to fear assassination too. You seem to have given this a great deal of thought, Moody, and a very ingenious theory it is — though of course, I heard you recently got it into your head that one of your birthday presents contained a cunningly disguised basilisk egg, and smashed it to pieces before realizing it was a carriage clock. So you’ll understand if we don’t take you entirely seriously. . . . Now, now, Viktor! don’t go giving away anything else, now, or your charming friend will know exactly where to find us! Well, Dumbledore, we are all protective of our private domains, are we not? Do we not jealously guard the halls of learning that have been entrusted to us? Severus, you cannot pretend this isn’t happening! It’s been getting clearer and clearer for months. I am becoming seriously concerned, I can’t deny it — We need to talk, I want to talk now, while you can’t slip off, Severus. You’ve been avoiding me. This, Well? Do you see? It’s never been this clear, never since — But you must have noticed — What? What’s going on? Crouch attacked you? Crouch attacked you? The Triwizard judge? Dumbledore! It is a plot! You and your Ministry of Magic have lured me here under false pretenses, Dumbledore! This is not an equal competition! First you sneak Potter into the tournament, though he is underage! Now one of your Ministry friends attempts to put my champion out of action! I smell double-dealing and corruption in this whole affair, and you, Dumbledore, you, with your talk of closer international Wizarding links, of rebuilding old ties, of forgetting old differences — here’s what I think of you!",

And I’m still riding a Comet Two Sixty, Nice one, Mad-Eye, What can I do, Molly? No, no, I want to help!

I noticed you hadn’t left the train and I knew you had that Cloak. I thought you might be hiding for some reason. When I saw the blinds were drawn down on that compartment I thought I’d check.

No, you couldn’t, Anti-intruder jinxes on all of them. Security’s been tightened a hundredfold this summer. Someone’s coming down for you, Look.

Harry I came to see Dumbledore I know, He’s not there. Apparently he’s gone away again. No Nothing in particular, I just thought he might know what’s going on. . . .

No one from the Order writes to me anymore, not since Sirius — What? Well . . . I’ll see you around, Harry . . . How did he die? How did it happen? I’d love to know what Snape told him to convince him, We were in trouble, we were losing, Gibbon was down, but the rest of the Death Eaters seemed ready to fight to the death. Neville had been hurt, Bill had been savaged by Greyback . . . It was all dark . . . curses flying everywhere . . . The Malfoy boy had vanished, he must have slipped past, up the stairs . . . then more of them ran after him, but one of them blocked the stair behind them with some kind of curse. . . . Neville ran at it and got thrown up into the air — And then Snape was there, We just let them pass, We thought they were being chased by the Death Eaters — and next thing, the other Death Eaters and Greyback were back and we were fighting again — I thought I heard Snape shout something, but I don’t know what — You see! She still wants to marry him, even though he’s been bitten! She doesn’t care! But I don’t care either, I don’t care! I’ve told you a million times. . . . Harry, guess what? I’m sorry you couldn’t be there, Harry, it was very quiet. Which leaves you and me, Ron! Hold tight now, Ron, Mad-Eye, Mad-Eye said he’d expect the real Harry to be with the toughest, most skilled Aurors. He chased Mad-Eye first, and when Mundungus gave them away he switched to Kingsley. . . . Happy birthday, Harry, Wotcher, Arthur told us you were the one with the curly hair.

Remus, he can — So that’s why he left, to follow you! I couldn’t understand why he’d vanished. But what made him change targets? Hermione, there’s obviously been a mass breakout which the Ministry has hushed up. But what happened to you, Remus? Where’s George? Evening, River. Thanks, River, Muggles remain ignorant of the source of their suffering as they continue to sustain heavy casualties, However, we continue to hear truly inspirational stories of wizards and witches risking their own safety to protect Muggle friends and neighbors, often without the Muggles’ knowledge. I’d like to appeal to all our listeners to emulate their example, perhaps by casting a protective charm over any Muggle dwellings in your street. Many lives could be saved if such simple measures are taken. I’d say that it’s one short step from ‘Wizards first’ to ‘Purebloods first,’ and then to ‘Death Eaters,’ We’re all human, aren’t we? Every human life is worth the same, and worth saving. Which suits him, of course, The air of mystery is creating more terror than actually showing himself.

Kreacher said nothing, and there’s its twin, unnatural little beasts they are. Kreacher doesn’t know …” The Mudblood is talking to Kreacher as though she is my friend, if Kreacher’s Mistress saw him in such company, oh what would she say — Is it true? Is it Harry Potter? Kreacher can see the scar, it must be true, that’s that boy who stopped the Dark Lord, Kreacher wonders how he did it — Kreacher is cleaning, Kreacher is cleaning, Kreacher, Mistress would never forgive Kreacher if the tapestry was thrown out, seven centuries it’s been in the family, Kreacher must save it, Kreacher will not let Master and the blood traitors and the brats destroy it — What? What? What has he come for, Kreacher wonders? Master has gone out, Harry Potter. Nobody here but Kreacher! Master does not tell poor Kreacher where he is going, Master will not come back from the Department of Mysteries! Kreacher and his Mistress are alone again! Yes, Kreacher belongs to Miss Bellatrix, oh yes, Kreacher belongs to the Blacks, Kreacher wants his new mistress, Kreacher won’t go to the Potter brat, Kreacher won’t, won’t, won’t — won’t, won’t, won’t, won’t, won’t, won’t, won’t, won’t, won’t, Won’t, won’t, won’t, won’t — won’t, won’t, won’t, Won’t, won’t, won’t, won’t — won’t, won’t, won’t, Won’t, won’t, won’t, won’t — won’t, won’t, won’t, Oh, Master called me? Kreacher will do whatever Master wants, because Kreacher has no choice, but Kreacher is ashamed to have such a master, yes — Master wants me to follow the youngest of the Malfoys? Master wants me to spy upon the pure-blood great-nephew of my old mistress? . . Master said he wanted regular reports on what the Malfoy boy is doing, so Kreacher has come to give — Night and day, Master Malfoy eats in the Great Hall, he sleeps in a dormitory in the dungeons, he attends his classes in a variety of — The Mudblood is speaking to Kreacher, Kreacher will pretend he cannot hear — Yes, Master, Yes. Gone. Mundungus Fletcher, Mundungus Fletcher stole it all: Miss Bella’s and Miss Cissy’s pictures, my Mistress’s gloves, the Order of Merlin, First Class, the goblets with the family crest, and — and — — and the locket, Master Regulus’s locket, Kreacher did wrong, Kreacher failed in his orders! Kreacher saw him! Kreacher saw him coming out of Kreacher’s cupboard with his hands full of Kreacher’s treasures. Kreacher told the sneak thief to stop, but Mundungus Fletcher laughed and r-ran. . . . Master Sirius ran away, good riddance, for he was a bad boy and broke my Mistress’s heart with his lawless ways. But Master Regulus had proper pride; he knew what was due to the name of Black and the dignity of his pure blood. For years he talked of the Dark Lord, who was going to bring the wizards out of hiding to rule the Muggles and the Muggle-borns . . . and when he was sixteen years old, Master Regulus joined the Dark Lord. So proud, so proud, so happy to serve . And one day, a year after he had joined, Master Regulus came down to the kitchen to see Kreacher. Master Regulus always liked Kreacher. And Master Regulus said . . . he said . . . . . . he said that the Dark Lord required an elf. Oh yes, And Master Regulus had volunteered Kreacher. So Kreacher went to the Dark Lord. The Dark Lord did not tell Kreacher what they were to do, but took Kreacher with him to a cave beside the sea. And beyond the cave there was a cavern, and in the cavern was a great black lake . . . . . . There was a boat . . . There was a b-basin full of potion on the island. The D-Dark Lord made Kreacher drink it. . . . Kreacher drank, and as he drank, he saw terrible things . . . . Kreacher’s insides burned . . . Kreacher cried for Master Regulus to save him, he cried for his Mistress Black, but the Dark Lord only laughed . . . He made Kreacher drink all the potion . . . He dropped a locket into the empty basin. . . . He filled it with more potion. And then the Dark Lord sailed away, leaving Kreacher on the island. . . . Kreacher needed water, he crawled to the island’s edge and he drank from the black lake . . . and hands, dead hands, came out of the water and dragged Kreacher under the surface. . . . Master Regulus told Kreacher to come back, Master Regulus told Kreacher to come back, The house-elf’s highest law is his Master’s bidding, Kreacher was told to come home, so Kreacher came home. . . . M-Master Regulus took from his pocket a locket like the one the Dark Lord had, And he told Kreacher to take it and, when the basin was empty, to switch the lockets. . . . And he ordered — Kreacher to leave — without him. And he told Kreacher — to go home — and never to tell my Mistress — what he had done — but to destroy — the first locket. And he drank — all the potion — and Kreacher swapped the lockets — and watched . . . as Master Regulus . . . was dragged beneath the water . Kreacher, Stop him — stop him! Oh, don’t you see now how sick it is, the way they’ve got to obey? Nothing Kreacher did made any mark upon it, Kreacher tried everything, everything he knew, but nothing, nothing would work. . . . So many powerful spells upon the casing, Kreacher was sure the way to destroy it was to get inside it, but it would not open. . . . Kreacher punished himself, he tried again, he punished himself, he tried again. Kreacher failed to obey orders, Kreacher could not destroy the locket! And his Mistress was mad with grief, because Master Regulus had disappeared, and Kreacher could not tell her what had happened, no, because Master Regulus had f-f-forbidden him to tell any of the f-f-family what happened in the c-cave. . . . Sirius — Kreacher had been alone for a long time when Sirius came to live here, and he was probably starving for a bit of affection. I’m sure ‘Miss Cissy’ and ‘Miss Bella’ were perfectly lovely to Kreacher when he turned up, so he did them a favor and told them everything they wanted to know. I’ve said all along that wizards would pay for how they treat house-elves. Well, Voldemort did . . . and so did Sirius. Find Mundungus Fletcher? Kreacher, Kreacher has returned with the thief Mundungus Fletcher, Master. Kreacher apologizes for the delay in bringing the thief, Master, Fletcher knows how to avoid capture, has many hidey-holes and accomplices. Nevertheless, Kreacher cornered the thief in the end. Perhaps just one more, Master Harry, for luck? Thank you very much, Master, Shoes off, if you please, Master Harry, and hands washed before dinner, Master has not finished his soup, would Master prefer the savory stew, or else the treacle tart to which Master is so partial?",

I don’t think I’d have minded, I don’t like dancing very much. That was funny! Baboon’s . . . backside! Excuse me, My father’s the editor. Thanks, I’ll carry that owl, if you like, Here you are, He’s a sweet little owl, isn’t he? “It’s all right,” Oh yes,  Don’t worry. You’re just as sane as I am.” I believe He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back, and I believe you fought him and escaped from him. You can laugh! But people used to believe there were no such things as the Blibbering Humdinger or the Crumple-Horned Snorkack! No, After all, Cornelius Fudge has got his own private army. No, Yes, he has, Oh yes they do! Well, my father is very supportive of any anti-Ministry action! He’s always saying he’d believe anything of Fudge, I mean, the number of goblins Fudge has had assassinated! And of course he uses the Department of Mysteries to develop terrible poisons, which he feeds secretly to anybody who disagrees with him. And then there’s his Umgubular Slashkilter — Hello, I’m supporting Gryffindor, Look what it does . . . It’s good, isn’t it? I wanted to have it chewing up a serpent to represent Slytherin, you know, but there wasn’t time. Anyway . . . good luck, Ronald! Hello, These are nice, did you put them up? Tha’s exactly right, Good thinking, It’s often infested with nargles. Weasley Is Our King My dad thinks it’s an awful paper, He publishes important stories that he thinks the public needs to know. He doesn’t care about making money. No, he’s the editor of The Quibbler. But of course, They do it because it’s an honor, and, of course, to see their names in print. Daddy will be pleased, And, of course, that’ll be a very important story, so Harry’s might have to wait for the following issue, You’re being rather rude, you know, When you say ‘Sirius,’ are you talking about Stubby Boardman? The Department of Mysteries? But how are you going to get there? Who’s Grawp? So, Oh yes, I thought we’d settled that? We’re flying! There are other ways of flying than with broomsticks, The Crumple-Horned Snorkack can’t fly, but they can, and Hagrid says they’re very good at finding places their riders are looking for. I think there are six of us, actually, There’s no need, Look, here come more now. . . . You two must really smell . . . Oh it’s easy, Come here . . . Where do we go from here, then? Aquavirius maggots! I can hear them too, There are people in there! You know what could be in there? I think her ankle’s broken, I heard something crack, Anyway, one of them grabbed Ginny’s foot, I used the Reductor Curse and blew up Pluto in his face, but . . . I don’t know what they hit him with, but he’s gone a bit funny, I could hardly get him along at all . . . Yeah, Collo — aaaaaaaaargh . . . Daddy sold it to them, He got a very good price for it too, so we’re going to go on an expedition to Sweden this summer and see if we can catch a Crumple-Horned Snorkack. Hello, Hi, Well, I’ve lost most of my possessions, People take them and hide them, you know. Oh . . . well . . . I think they think I’m a bit odd, you know. Some people call me ‘Loony’ Lovegood, actually. Oh, They’ll come back, they always do in the end. No, I don’t suppose you do. That man the Death Eaters killed was your godfather, wasn’t he? Ginny told me. Yes, I was nine. Yes, it was rather horrible, I still feel very sad about it sometimes. But I’ve still got Dad. And anyway, it’s not as though I’ll never see Mum again, is it? Oh, In that room with the archway. They were just lurking out of sight, that’s all. You heard them. Oh, No, I think I’ll just go down and have some pudding and wait for it all to turn up. . . . It always does in the end. . . . Well, have a nice holiday, Harry. Hello, Harry, Very well, thank you, Oh yes, circulation’s well up, Harry? I enjoyed the meetings too, It was like having friends. People expect you to have cooler friends than us, That’s a very nice thing to say, Wrackspurt got you? A Wrackspurt . . . They’re invisible. They float in through your ears and make your brain go fuzzy, I thought I felt one zooming around in here. Oh, hello, Harry, Did you know one of your eyebrows is bright yellow? She’s a bit upset, I thought at first it was Moaning Myrtle in there, but it turned out to be Hermione. She said something about that Ron Weasley. . . . He says very funny things sometimes, doesn’t he? But he can be a bit unkind. I noticed that last year. Oh, it’s been all right. A bit lonely without the D.A. Ginny’s been nice, though. She stopped two boys in our Transfiguration class calling me ‘Loony’ the other day — Slughorn’s party? With you? Oh, no, I’d love to go with you as friends! Nobody’s ever asked me to a party before, as a friend! Is that why you dyed your eyebrow, for the party? Should I do mine too? Oh yes, Where is the party? Rufus Scrimgeour? Yeah, Father wrote a very long article about it when Scrimgeour first took over from Cornelius Fudge, but he was forced not to publish by somebody from the Ministry. Obviously, they didn’t want the truth to get out! Hello, No, I’ve got Firenze this year, I don’t think you should be an Auror, Harry, The Aurors are part of the Rotfang Conspiracy All right, Of course, . . . but now that big Hufflepuff player’s got the Quaffle from her, I can’t remember his name, it’s something like Bibble — no, Buggins — And Harry Potter’s now having an argument with his Keeper, I don’t think that’ll help him find the Snitch, but maybe it’s a clever ruse. . . . Oh, Oh, look! The Gryffindor Keeper’s got hold of one of the Beater’s bats. Hello, Harry! Oh, have you changed that too? Oh, just your expression, Daddy, look — one of the gnomes actually bit me! Ron can laugh, but my father has done a lot of research on Gernumbli magic. Oh, it’s fine, You look smart. I told Daddy most people would probably wear dress robes, but he believes you ought to wear sun colors to a wedding, for luck, you know. Harry? Ron? Is that you? Harry? Ron? Harry? Ron? Ron? No, Oh no, I didn’t want you to be caught! Oh yes, I expect so. . . . There’s an old nail we use if we need to break anything. . . . Just a moment . . . Mr. Ollivander? Mr. Ollivander, have you got the nail?  If you just move over a little bit .. . I think it was beside the water jug. . . . You’ll need to stay still, Ron, please stay still! Oh, that’s much easier, thanks, Ron, Hello, Dean! There’s no way out, Ron, The cellar is completely escape-proof. I tried, at first. Mr. Ollivander has been here for a long time, he’s tried everything. Harry, we want to help you! We should close his eyes. There, Now he could be sleeping. I think we ought to say something, I’ll go first, shall I? Thank you so much, Dobby, for rescuing me from that cellar. It’s so unfair that you had to die, when you were so good and brave. I’ll always remember what you did for us. I hope you’re happy now. . . . and tiny little ears, a bit like a hippo’s, Daddy says, only purple and hairy. And if you want to call them, you have to hum; they prefer a waltz, nothing too fast. . . . . . . and if you ever come to our house I’ll be able to show you the horn, Daddy wrote to me about it but I haven’t seen it yet, because the Death Eaters took me from the Hogwarts Express and I never got home for Christmas, No, it was definitely a Snorkack horn, Daddy told me. It will probably have re-formed by now, they mend themselves, you know. I’m going to miss you, Mr. Ollivander, Daddy’s made a tiara, Well, more of a crown, really. Yes, he’s trying to re-create the lost diadem of Ravenclaw. He thinks he’s identified most of the main elements now. Adding the billywig wings really made a difference — We got your message, Neville! Hello you three, I thought you must be here! Hi, everyone! Oh, it’s great to be back! Of course that’s what it means, Isn’t it, Harry? We’re going to fight them out of Hogwarts? Well, there’s her lost diadem. I told you about it, remember, Harry? The lost diadem of Ravenclaw? Daddy’s trying to duplicate it. Yes, Daddy’s Wrackspurt siphons — Oooh, yes, I’d like to, This way, Harry, Hmm . . . What do you think, Harry? Oh, Well, you have to wait for somebody who gets it right, That way you learn, you see? No, I see what you mean, Well then, I think the answer is that a circle has no beginning. I’ve never Stunned anyone except in our D. A. lessons, That was noisier than I thought it would be. Oh, look, They’re pleased! Oh, are we allowed to say the name now? That’s right, That’s right, Harry . . . come on, think of something happy. . . . We’re all still here, we’re still fighting. Come on, now. . . .",

Tut, tut, That won’t do, now, will it? ’ One more time, please. Good afternoon, class! Good afternoon, Professor Umbridge, There, now, That wasn’t too difficult, was it? Wands away and quills out, please. Well now, your teaching in this subject has been rather disrupted and fragmented, hasn’t it? The constant changing of teachers, many of whom do not seem to have followed any Ministry-approved curriculum, has unfortunately resulted in your being far below the standard we would expect to see in your O. W.L. year. You will be pleased to know, however, that these problems are now to be rectified. We will be following a carefully structured, theory-centered, Ministry-approved course of defensive magic this year. Copy down the following, please. Has everybody got a copy of Defensive Magical Theory by Wilbert Slinkhard?  I think we’ll try that again, I should like you to turn to page five and read chapter one, ‘Basics for Beginners. ’ There will be no need to talk. Did you want to ask something about the chapter, dear? Well, we’re reading just now, If you have other queries we can deal with them at the end of class. And your name is — ? Well, Miss Granger, I think the course aims are perfectly clear if you read them through carefully, Using defensive spells? Why, I can’t imagine any situation arising in my classroom that would require you to use a defensive spell, Miss Granger. You surely aren’t expecting to be attacked during class? Students raise their hands when they wish to speak in my class, Mr. — ? Yes, Miss Granger? You wanted to ask something else? Are you a Ministry-trained educational expert, Miss Granger? Wizards much older and cleverer than you have devised our new program of study. You will be learning about defensive spells in a secure, risk-free way — Hand, Mr. Potter! And your name is — ? Well, Mr. Thomas? I repeat, do you expect to be attacked during my classes? Hand, Mr. Thomas! As I was saying — you have been introduced to spells that have been complex, inappropriate to your age group, and potentially lethal. You have been frightened into believing that you are likely to meet Dark attacks every other day — Your hand is not up, Miss Granger! It is my understanding that my predecessor not only performed illegal curses in front of you, he actually performed them on you — And your name is — ? Now, it is the view of the Ministry that a theoretical knowledge will be more than sufficient to get you through your examination, which, after all, is what school is all about. And your name is? As long as you have studied the theory hard enough, there is no reason why you should not be able to perform the spells under carefully controlled examination conditions, I repeat, This is school, Mr. Potter, not the real world, There is nothing waiting out there, Mr. Potter. Who do you imagine wants to attack children like yourselves? “Ten points from Gryffindor, Mr. Potter.” Mr.-Potter-you-have-already-lost-your-House-ten-points-do-not-make-matters-worse-for-yourself, As I was saying, you have been informed that a certain Dark wizard is at large once again. This is a lie. Tomorrow evening. Five o’clock.  My office.  I repeat, this is a lie. The Ministry of Magic guarantees that you are not in danger from any Dark wizard. If you are still worried, by all means come and see me outside class hours. If someone is alarming you with fibs about reborn Dark wizards, I would like to hear about it. I am here to help. I am your friend. And now, you will kindly continue your reading. Page five, ‘Basics for Beginners. ’ Cedric Diggory’s death was a tragic accident, Come here, Mr. Potter, dear. Take this to Professor McGonagall, dear, Good evening, Mr. Potter. Well, sit down, What? Oh no, Oh no, no, no. No, you will come here at five o’clock tomorrow, and the next day, and on Friday too, and you will do your detentions as planned. I think it rather a good thing that you are missing something you really want to do. It ought to reinforce the lesson I am trying to teach you. No, we’re getting better at controlling our temper already, aren’t we? Now, you are going to be doing some lines for me, Mr. Potter. No, not with your quill, she added, as Harry bent down to open his bag. You’re going to be using a rather special one of mine. Here you are. I must not tell lies. I must not tell lies. I must not tell lies. I must not tell lies. Oh, as long as it takes for the message to sink in, Off you go. Oh, you won’t need ink, Yes? Come here,” “Hand,” Tut, tut, I don’t seem to have made much of an impression yet, Well, we’ll just have to try again tomorrow evening, won’t we? You may go. Ah, You may leave for tonight. Oh yes, Yes, I think we can etch the message a little deeper with another evening’s work. Good afternoon, Professor Trelawney, You received my note, I trust? Giving the time and date of your inspection? Now, you’ve been in this post how long, exactly? Quite a period, So it was Professor Dumbledore who appointed you? And you are a great-great-granddaughter of the celebrated Seer Cassandra Trelawney? But I think — correct me if I am mistaken — that you are the first in your family since Cassandra to be possessed of second sight? Of course, Well, if you could just predict something for me, then? I’d like you to make a prediction for me, I see, Right, Well, if that’s really the best you can do . . . Wands away, As we finished chapter one last lesson, I would like you all to turn to page nineteen today and commence chapter two, ‘Common Defensive Theories and Their Derivation. ’ There will be no need to talk. What is it this time, Miss Granger? Well then, proceed to chapter three. Well, then, you should be able to tell me what Slinkhard says about counterjinxes in chapter fifteen. You disagree? Oh, you do, do you? Well, I’m afraid it is Mr. Slinkhard’s opinion, and not yours, that matters within this classroom, Miss Granger. That is enough, Miss Granger, I am going to take five points from Gryffindor House. For disrupting my class with pointless interruptions, I am here to teach you using a Ministry-approved method that does not include inviting students to give their opinions on matters about which they understand very little. Your previous teachers in this subject may have allowed you more license, but as none of them — with the possible exception of Professor Quirrell, who did at least appear to have restricted himself to age-appropriate subjects — would have passed a Ministry inspection — I think another week’s detentions would do you some good, Mr. Potter, Hem, hem, Hem, hem, I was just wondering, Professor, whether you received my note telling you of the date and time of your inspec — Hem, hem, How long have you been teaching at Hogwarts? Very well, you will receive the results of your inspection in ten days’ time. Hmm, I wonder — the headmaster seems strangely reluctant to give me any information on the matter — can you tell me what is causing Professor Hagrid’s very extended leave of absence? ’Fraid I can’t, Don’t know anything more about it than you do. Right, Well? Do you feel you receive enough support from the school management? And what are you planning to cover with this class this year — assuming, of course, that Professor Hagrid does not return? Now, Now, I hear there have been injuries in this class? A hippogriff? That will do, Well, thank you very much, Professor Grubbly-Plank, I think that’s all I need here. You will be receiving the results of your inspection within ten days. Well, the class seems fairly advanced for their level, Though I would question whether it is advisable to teach them a potion like the Strengthening Solution. I think the Ministry would prefer it if that was removed from the syllabus. Now . . . how long have you been teaching at Hogwarts? You applied first for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post, I believe? But you were unsuccessful? And you have applied regularly for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post since you first joined the school, I believe? Do you have any idea why Dumbledore has consistently refused to appoint you? Oh I shall, Oh yes, Yes, the Ministry wants a thorough understanding of teachers’ — er — backgrounds . . . Good afternoon, class. Wands away, please . . . Please turn to page thirty-four of Defensive Magical Theory and read the third chapter, entitled ‘The Case for Non-Offensive Responses to Magical Attack. ’ There will be — Hem, hem. May I help, Professor McGonagall? Oh, Hem, hem. I think they deserve rather more than detentions, Oh, I think you’ll find that what I think does count. Now, where is it? Cornelius just sent it. . . . I mean, the Minister just sent it. . . . Ah yes . . . Hem, hem . . . ‘Educational Decree Number Twenty-five . . .’ Well, yes, As a matter of fact, Minerva, it was you who made me see that we needed a further amendment.. . . You remember how you overrode me, when I was unwilling to allow the Gryffindor Quidditch team to re-form? How you took the case to Dumbledore, who insisted that the team be allowed to play? Well, now, I couldn’t have that. I contacted the Minister at once, and he quite agreed with me that the High Inquisitor has to have the power to strip pupils of privileges, or she — that is to say, I — would have less authority than common teachers! And you see now, don’t you, Minerva, how right I was in attempting to stop the Gryffindor team re-forming? Signed, Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic, Order of Merlin First Class, etc., etc. …’ ” So . . . I really think I will have to ban these two from playing Quidditch ever again, Well, yes, You and Mr. Weasley here. And I think, to be safe, this young man’s twin ought to be stopped too — if his teammates had not restrained him, I feel sure he would have attacked young Mr. Malfoy as well. I will want their broomsticks confiscated, of course; I shall keep them safely in my office, to make sure there is no infringement of my ban. But I am not unreasonable, Professor McGonagall, The rest of the team can continue playing, I saw no signs of violence from any of them. Well . . . good afternoon to you. Hem, hem. Hem, hem. You received the note I sent to your cabin this morning? Telling you that I would be inspecting your lesson? Excuse me, What did you say? ‘Appears . . . to . . . have . . . poor . . . short . . . term . . . memory . . .’ Are you aware, that the Ministry of Magic has classified thestrals as ‘dangerous’? ‘Shows . . . signs . . . of . . . pleasure . . . at . . . idea . . . of . . . violence . . .’ Do you find, that you are able to understand Professor Hagrid when he talks? Thestrals, Whom did you see die? So? ‘Students . . . are . . . too . . . intimidated . . . to . . . admit . . . they . . . are . . . frightened . . .’ It’s quite all right, Well, Hagrid, I think I’ve got enough to be getting along with. . . . You will receive in ten days’ time. “the results of your inspection” What is going on here? Why have you got all these letters, Mr. Potter? Be careful, Mr. Weasley, or I shall have to put you in detention, Well, Mr. Potter? An interview? What do you mean? When did you do this? There will be no more Hogsmeade trips for you, Mr. Potter, How you dare . . . how you could . . . I have tried again and again to teach you not to tell lies. The message, apparently, has still not sunk in. Fifty points from Gryffindor and another week’s worth of detentions. It’s him! Excellent, Draco, excellent, oh, very good — fifty points to Slytherin! I’ll take him from here. . . . Stand up, Potter! You hop along and see if you can round up anymore of them, Draco, Tell the others to look in the library — anybody out of breath — check the bathrooms, Miss Parkinson can do the girls’ ones — off you go — and you, You can come with me to the headmaster’s office, Potter. Fizzing Whizbee, He was heading back to Gryffindor Tower, The Malfoy boy cornered him. I think, Minister, we might make better progress if I fetch our informant. Don’t be scared, dear, don’t be frightened, it’s quite all right, now. You have done the right thing. The Minister is very pleased with you. He’ll be telling your mother what a good girl you’ve been. Marietta’s mother, Minister, is Madam Edgecombe from the Department of Magical Transportation. Floo Network office — she’s been helping us police the Hogwarts fires, you know. Oh, very well, you silly girl, I’ll tell him, Well, Minister, Miss Edgecombe here came to my office shortly after dinner this evening and told me she had something she wanted to tell me. She said that if I proceeded to a secret room on the seventh floor, sometimes known as the Room of Requirement, I would find out something to my advantage. I questioned her a little further and she admitted that there was to be some kind of meeting there. Unfortunately at that point this hex, came into operation and upon catching sight of her face in my mirror the girl became too distressed to tell me any more. I have not yet managed to find one, But it doesn’t matter if she won’t speak, I can take up the story from here. You will remember, Minister, that I sent you a report back in October that Potter had met a number of fellow students in the Hog’s Head in Hogsmeade — The purpose of Potter’s meeting with these students, was to persuade them to join an illegal society, whose aim was to learn spells and curses the Ministry has decided are inappropriate for school-age — That’s all very fine, Headmaster, But we are now nearly six months on from the introduction of Educational Decree Number Twenty-four. If the first meeting was not illegal, all those that have happened since most certainly are. Evidence? Have you not been listening, Dumbledore? Why do you think Miss Edgecombe is here? Miss Edgecombe, tell us how long these meetings have been going on, dear. You can simply nod or shake your head, I’m sure that won’t make the spots worse. Have they been happening regularly over the last six months? Just nod or shake your head, dear, Come on, now, that won’t activate the jinx further . . . I don’t think you understood the question, did you, dear? I’m asking whether you’ve been going to these meetings for the past six months? You have, haven’t you? What do you mean by shaking your head, dear? Miss Edgecombe, There was a meeting, Miss Edgecombe, you told me about it, in the Room of Requirement! And Potter was the leader, was he not, Potter organized it, Potter — why are you shaking your head, girl? No, I mean, yes — you’re right, Shacklebolt — I — I forgot myself. Yes, yes . . . well, Miss Edgecombe tipped me off and I proceeded at once to the seventh floor, accompanied by certain trustworthy students, so as to catch those in the meeting red-handed. It appears that they were forewarned of my arrival, however, because when we reached the seventh floor they were running in every direction. It does not matter, however. I have all their names here, Miss Parkinson ran into the Room of Requirement for me to see if they had left anything behind. . . . We needed evidence and the room provided . . . The moment I saw Potter’s name on the list, I knew what we were dealing with, Well, he can’t have Disapparated! Thank you, Argus, Sit, what? What would you like to drink? What? To drink, Mr. Potter, Tea? Coffee? Pumpkin juice? I wish you to have a drink with me, Choose one. There, Drink it before it gets cold, won’t you?   Well, now, Mr. Potter . . . I thought we ought to have a little chat, after the distressing events of last night. You’re not drinking up! What’s the matter? Do you want sugar? Good, Very good. Now then . Where is Albus Dumbledore? Well now, Now, Mr. Potter, let us not play childish games. I know that you know where he has gone. You and Dumbledore have been in this together from the beginning. Consider your position, Mr. Potter . . . Very good.  In that case, you will kindly tell me the whereabouts of Sirius Black. Mr. Potter, let me remind you that it was I who almost caught the criminal Black in the Gryffindor fire in October. I know perfectly well it was you he was meeting and if I had had any proof neither of you would be at large today, I promise you. I repeat, Mr. Potter . . . Where is Sirius Black? ’Course we have, The might of the Ministry stands behind me. All channels of communication in and out of this school are being monitored. A Floo Network Regulator is keeping watch over every fire in Hogwarts — except my own, of course. My Inquisitorial Squad is opening and reading all owl post entering and leaving the castle. And Mr. Filch is observing all secret passages in and out of the castle. If I find a shred of evidence . . . What was — ? Back to lunch with you, Potter! Hurry, Filch, hurry! They’ll be all over the school unless we do something — Stupefy! Don’t Stun them, Filch! Oh no, thank you very much, I just wondered whether I could make the teensiest interruption, Minerva? I was just wondering whether Mr. Potter has quite the temperament for an Auror? Oh, no need, thank you, Minerva, I was just concerned that you might not have Harry’s most recent Defense Against the Dark Arts marks in front of you. I’m quite sure I slipped in a note . . . Did you not understand my note, Minerva? Well, then, I am confused. . . . I’m afraid I don’t quite understand how you can give Mr. Potter false hope that — I’m terribly sorry to have to contradict you, Minerva, but as you will see from my note, Harry has been achieving very poor results in his classes with me — I think you’ll also find, that the Ministry looks into the records of those applying to be Aurors. Their criminal records. — which means that this boy has as much chance of becoming an Auror as Dumbledore has of ever returning to this school. Potter has a criminal record, Potter has no chance whatsoever of becoming an Auror! The Minister of Magic will never employ Harry Potter! Aha! Yes! Yes, yes, yes! Of course! That’s what you want, isn’t it, Minerva McGonagall? You want Cornelius Fudge replaced by Albus Dumbledore! You think, that after two nifflers I was going to let one more foul, scavenging little creature enter my office without my knowledge? I had Stealth Sensoring Spells placed all around my doorway after the last one got in, you foolish boy. Take his wand, Hers too . . . I want to know why you are in my office, Liar. Your Firebolt is under strict guard in the dungeons, as you very well know, Potter. You had your head in my fire. With whom have you been communicating? Liar! Very well, very well, Well, it looks as though Hogwarts will shortly be a Weasley-free zone, doesn’t it? So, Potter, You stationed lookouts around my office and you sent this buffoon, to tell me the poltergeist was wreaking havoc in the Transfiguration department when I knew perfectly well that he was busy smearing ink on the eyepieces of all the school telescopes, Mr. Filch having just informed me so. Clearly, it was very important for you to talk to somebody. Was it Albus Dumbledore? Or the half-breed, Hagrid? I doubt it was Minerva McGonagall, I hear she is still too ill to talk to anyone . . . Very well, very well, Very well, Mr. Potter . . . I offered you the chance to tell me freely. You refused. I have no alternative but to force you. Draco — fetch Professor Snape. Yes, You can make some more, can’t you? A month? A month? But I need it this evening, Snape! I have just found Potter using my fire to communicate with a person or persons unknown! I wish to interrogate him! I wish you to provide me with a potion that will force him to tell me the truth! You are on probation! You are being deliberately unhelpful! I expected better, Lucius Malfoy always speaks most highly of you! Now get out of my office! What? What? What is Padfoot? Where what is hidden? What does he mean, Snape? Okay, Very well . . . I am left with no alternative. . . . This is more than a matter of school discipline. . . . This is an issue of Ministry security. . . . Yes . . . yes . . . You are forcing me, Potter. . . . I do not want to, but sometimes circumstances justify the use . . . I am sure the Minister will understand that I had no choice . . . The Cruciatus Curse ought to loosen your tongue, What Cornelius doesn’t know won’t hurt him, He never knew I ordered dementors after Potter last summer, but he was delighted to be given the chance to expel him, all the same. . . . Somebody had to act, They were all bleating about silencing you somehow — discrediting you — but I was the one who actually did something about it . . . Only you wriggled out of that one, didn’t you, Potter? Not today, though, not now . . . Very well, very well, Little Miss Question-All is going to give us some answers! Come on then, girl, come on! That’s right, that’s right, girl! Now then . . . with whom was Potter communicating just now? Dumbledore? You know where Dumbledore is, then? Idiot girl, Dumbledore won’t be sitting in a pub when the whole Ministry’s looking for him! What? What? What was it you wanted to tell him? What’s ready? What’s ready, girl? Weapon? Weapon? You have been developing some method of resistance? A weapon you could use against the Ministry? On Professor Dumbledore’s orders, of course? Weapon? Weapon? Lead me to the weapon, It is not for you to set conditions, Right, . . and we’ll take Potter too, shall we? Get up, now — I am a fully qualified Ministry official, Malfoy, do you really think I cannot manage two wandless teenagers alone? In any case, it does not sound as though this weapon is something that schoolchildren should see. You will remain here until I return and make sure none of these escape. And you two can go ahead of me and show me the way, Lead on . . . It’s hidden in Hagrid’s hut, is it? Yes, Yes, he would have done, of course, the great half-breed oaf . . . Then . . . where is it? Of course, Of course . . . very well, then . . . you two stay ahead of me. No, I don’t think so, Mr. Potter, The Ministry places a rather higher value on my life than yours, I’m afraid. Is it very far in? How much further? I am Dolores Umbridge! Senior Undersecretary to the Minister of Magic and Headmistress and High Inquisitor of Hogwarts! That’s right! So be very careful! By the laws laid down by the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, any attack by half-breeds such as yourselves on a human — Law Fifteen B states clearly that ‘Any attack by a magical creature who is deemed to have near-human intelligence, and therefore considered responsible for its actions —’ Filthy half-breeds! Beasts! Uncontrolled animals! Incarcerous! Nooooo! Noooooo . . . I am Senior Undersecretary . . . you cannot . . . unhand me, you animals . . . nooooo! No . . . no . . . no, I must have been dreaming . . . Ah, Good, you’ll do perfectly well. That’s that problem solved, Minister, if Mafalda can be spared for record-keeping we shall be able to start straightaway. Ten people today and one of them the wife of a Ministry employee! Tut, tut . . . even here, in the heart of the Ministry! We’ll go straight down, Mafalda, you’ll find everything you need in the courtroom. Good morning, Albert, aren’t you getting out? This is your final warning, If you struggle, you will be subjected to the Dementor’s Kiss. Take him away, Next — Mary Cattermole, Sit down, You are Mary Elizabeth Cattermole? Married to Reginald Cattermole of the Magical Maintenance Department? Mother to Maisie, Ellie, and Alfred Cattermole? A wand was taken from you upon your arrival at the Ministry today, Mrs. Cattermole, Eight-and-three-quarter inches, cherry, unicorn-hair core. Do you recognize that description?

I thought, that to belong in Gryffindor House you were supposed to be brave? It looks to me as though you would have been better off in my own House. We Slytherins are brave, yes, but not stupid. For instance, given the choice, we will always choose to save our own necks. Oh I see, This is no cowardly flight — you are being noble. I have a message for you from Albus Dumbledore. Stay where you are. Stay where you are. Nothing whatsoever, You know, this is precisely why I loathed being a teacher! Young people are so infernally convinced that they are absolutely right about everything. Has it not occurred to you, my poor puffed-up popinjay, that there might be an excellent reason why the headmaster of Hogwarts is not confiding every tiny detail of his plans to you? No. No, like all young people, you are quite sure that you alone feel and think, you alone recognize danger, you alone are the only one clever enough to realize what the Dark Lord may be planning . . . Did I say that? Now, if you will excuse me, I have better things to do than to listen to adolescent agonizing. . . . Good day to you . . . “You know, Minister, I disagree with Dumbledore on many counts … but you cannot deny he’s got style. …” Ah . . . Harry Potter . . . And what brings you here in the early hours of the morning? This office is supposed to be barred to all but the rightful headmaster. Or has Dumbledore sent you here? Oh, don’t tell me . . . Another message for my worthless great-great-grandson? You see, Dumbledore? Never try to understand the students. They hate it. They would much rather be tragically misunderstood, wallow in self-pity, stew in their own — Am I to understand, that my great-great-grandson — the last of the Blacks — is dead? I don’t believe it, Impertinent, I would not have permitted a student to question the way Hogwarts operated in my day. That mangy old half-blood has been stealing Black heirlooms? I should think not, I can’t see why the boy should be able to do it better than you, Dumbledore. ‘Please’ always helps, said a cold, snide voice, and Phineas Nigellus slid into his portrait.At once, Hermione cried: What — how dare — what are you — ? Remove this foul addition at once! Remove it, I say! You are ruining a great work of art! Where am I? What is going on? Can that possibly be the voice of the elusive Mr. Potter? Ah, yes. That silly girl acted most unwisely there — Who else is here? Your tone displeases me! The girl and her friends were foolhardy in the extreme. Thieving from the headmaster! It belongs to Professor Snape’s school, Exactly what claim did the Weasley girl have upon it? She deserved her punishment, as did the idiot Longbottom and the Lovegood oddity! Where am I? Where have you brought me? Why have you removed me from the house of my forebears? Professor Snape sent them into the Forbidden Forest, to do some work for the oaf, Hagrid. Muggle-borns, Goblin-made armor does not require cleaning, simple girl. Goblins’ silver repels mundane dirt, imbibing only that which strengthens it. I grow weary of contradiction, Perhaps it is time for me to return to the headmaster’s office? What? What did you see? What do you mean? Muggle-borns, The portraits of Hogwarts may commune with each other, but they cannot travel outside the castle except to visit a painting of themselves hanging elsewhere. Dumbledore cannot come here with me, and after the treatment I have received at your hands, I can assure you that I shall not be making a return visit! I believe that the last time I saw the sword of Gryffindor leave its case was when Professor Dumbledore used it to break open a ring. Well, good night to you, Professor Snape has more important things on his mind than the many eccentricities of Albus Dumbledore. Good-bye, Potter!

He’s in a closed ward, you know, he must have slipped out while I was bringing in the Christmas presents, the door’s usually kept locked . . . not that he’s dangerous! But, bit of a danger to himself, bless him. . . . Doesn’t know who he is, you see, wanders off and can’t remember how to get back. . . . It is nice of you to have come to see him — Alohomora.”  This is our long-term resident ward, For permanent spell damage, you know. Of course, with intensive remedial potions and charms and a bit of luck, we can produce some improvement. . . . Gilderoy does seem to be getting back some sense of himself, and we’ve seen a real improvement in Mr. Bode, he seems to be regaining the power of speech very well, though he isn’t speaking any language we recognize yet. . . . Well, I must finish giving out the Christmas presents, I’ll leave you all to chat . . . Here you are, Agnes, See, not forgotten, are you? And your son’s sent an owl to say he’s visiting tonight, so that’s nice, isn’t it? And look, Broderick, you’ve been sent a potted plant and a lovely calendar with a different fancy hippogriff for each month, they’ll brighten things up, won’t they? And — oh, Mrs. Longbottom, are you leaving already?",

You want me to report what he says about He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named? The Prophet wouldn’t print it. In case you haven’t noticed, nobody believes his cock-and-bull story. Everyone thinks he’s delusional. Now, if you let me write the story from that angle — There’s no market for a story like that, All right, Fudge is leaning on the Prophet, but it comes to the same thing. They won’t print a story that shows Harry in a good light. Nobody wants to read it. It’s against the public mood. This last Azkaban breakout has got people quite worried enough.

No, no, my dear Molly, I don’t want to intrude, wouldn’t be here at all if Percy hadn’t wanted to see you all so badly. . . . Hmmm, No, no, I assure you I don’t want to butt in! Well, if anybody cared to show me your charming garden . . . Ah, that young man’s finished, why doesn’t he take a stroll with me? Wonderful! We’ll just take a turn around the garden, and Percy and I’ll be off. Carry on, everyone! Charming, Charming. I’ve wanted to meet you for a very long time, Did you know that? Oh. But Dumbledore has been very protective of you, Natural, of course, natural, after what you’ve been through. . . . Especially what happened at the Ministry . . . The rumors that have flown around! Well, of course, we both know how these stories get distorted . . . all these whispers of a prophecy . . . of you being ‘the Chosen One’ . . . . . . I assume that Dumbledore has discussed these matters with you? Have you, have you . . . And what has Dumbledore told you, Harry? Oh. Well, of course, to you it will matter enormously, But to the Wizarding community at large . . . it’s all perception, isn’t it? It’s what people believe that’s important. They think you quite the hero — which, of course, you are, Harry, chosen or not! How many times have you faced He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named now? Well, anyway, the point is, you are a symbol of hope for many, Harry. The idea that there is somebody out there who might be able, who might even be destined, to destroy He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named — well, naturally, it gives people a lift. And I can’t help but feel that, once you realize this, you might consider it, well, almost a duty, to stand alongside the Ministry, and give everyone a boost. Funny little chaps, aren’t they? But what say you, Harry? Oh. It would give everyone a lift to think you were more involved, Harry, ‘The Chosen One,’ you know . . . It’s all about giving people hope, the feeling that exciting things are happening. . . . Well, well, yes, that’s partly why we’d like — I would not expect you to understand, These are dangerous times, and certain measures need to be taken. You are sixteen years old — I see. You prefer — like your hero, Dumbledore — to disassociate yourself from the Ministry? Some would say it’s your duty to be used by the Ministry! So you’re not ‘the Chosen One’? I shouldn’t have said that, What? Where does he go when he is absent from Hogwarts? And you wouldn’t tell me if you knew, would you? Well, then, I shall have to see whether I can’t find out by other means. Well, it is clear to me that he has done a very good job on you, Harry! I’ve been hoping to have a word . . . do you mind if I walk a little way with you? Harry, this was a dreadful tragedy, I cannot tell you how appalled I was to hear of it. Dumbledore was a very great wizard. We had our disagreements, as you know, but no one knows better than I — You are, of course, devastated, I know that you were very close to Dumbledore. I think you may have been his favorite pupil ever. The bond between the two of you — The word is that you were with him when he left the school the night that he died. Somebody Stupefied a Death Eater on top of the tower after Dumbledore died. There were also two broomsticks up there. The Ministry can add two and two, Harry. Such loyalty is admirable, of course, but Dumbledore is gone, Harry. He’s gone. My dear boy . . . even Dumbledore cannot return from the — The Ministry can offer you all sorts of protection, you know, Harry. I would be delighted to place a couple of my Aurors at your service — So, — for raising everyone’s morale! I see you are — Sorry to intrude, Especially as I can see that I am gate-crashing a party. Many happy returns. I require a private word with you, Also with Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Hermione Granger. I shall tell you that when we are somewhere more private, Is there such a place? You can lead the way, There will be no need for you to accompany us, Arthur. I have some questions for the three of you, and I think it will be best if we do it individually. If you two can wait upstairs, I will start with Ronald. Very well then, together, I am here, as I’m sure you know, because of Albus Dumbledore’s will. A surprise, apparently! You were not aware then that Dumbledore had left you anything? Yes, all of — Are you planning to follow a career in Magical Law, Miss Granger? Would you say you were close to Dumbledore, Ronald? If you were not very close to Dumbledore, how do you account for the fact that he remembered you in his will? He made exceptionally few personal bequests. The vast majority of his possessions — his private library, his magical instruments, and other personal effects — were left to Hogwarts. Why do you think you were singled out? ‘The Last Will and Testament of Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore’ . . . Yes, here we are . . . ‘To Ronald Bilius Weasley, I leave my Deluminator, in the hope that he will remember me when he uses it.  How are you? It may even be unique. Certainly it is of Dumbledore’s own design. Why would he have left you an item so rare? Dumbledore must have taught thousands of students, Yet the only ones he remembered in his will are you three. Why is that? To what use did he think you would put his Deluminator, Mr. Weasley? Why do you think Dumbledore left you that book, Miss Granger? But why that particular book? Did you ever discuss codes, or any means of passing secret messages, with Dumbledore? ‘I leave the Snitch he caught in his first Quidditch match at Hogwarts, as a reminder of the rewards of perseverance and skill.  How are you? You think this a mere symbolic keepsake, then? I’m asking the questions, I notice that your birthday cake is in the shape of a Snitch, Why is that? I don’t think there’s anything hidden in the icing, but a Snitch would be a very good hiding place for a small object. You know why, I’m sure? Correct, A Snitch is not touched by bare skin before it is released, not even by the maker, who wears gloves. It carries an enchantment by which it can identify the first human to lay hands upon it, in case of a disputed capture. This Snitch will remember your touch, Potter. It occurs to me that Dumbledore, who had prodigious magical skill, whatever his other faults, might have enchanted this Snitch so that it will open only for you. You don’t say anything, Perhaps you already know what the Snitch contains? Take it, Not quite, Dumbledore left you a second bequest, Potter. The sword of Godric Gryffindor, Unfortunately, that sword was not Dumbledore’s to give away. The sword of Godric Gryffindor is an important historical artifact, and as such, belongs — This is not a joke, Potter! Was it because Dumbledore believed that only the sword of Godric Gryffindor could defeat the Heir of Slytherin? Did he wish to give you that sword, Potter, because he believed, as do many, that you are the one destined to destroy He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named? You go too far! Right? Remembered that I am not Dumbledore, who forgave your insolence and insubordination? You may wear that scar like a crown, Potter, but it is not up to a seventeen-year-old boy to tell me how to do my job! It’s time you learned some respect! It — it was nothing, I . . . regret your attitude, You seem to think that the Ministry does not desire what you — what Dumbledore — desired. We ought to be working together.",

What gave it away? The Dark Mark, Knew there was something . . . ah well. Please, On the walls? Dragon, Yes My last bottle, and prices are sky-high at the moment. Still, it might be reusable. Hmm. Bit dusty. Oho, Oho! So that’s how you thought you’d persuade me, is it? Well, the answer’s no, Albus. All right then, one drink, Hmpf, Not so well, Weak chest. Wheezy. Rheumatism too.Can’t move like I used to. Well, that’s to be expected Old age. Fatigue. Still, the fact remains that I’m an old man, Albus. A tired old man who’s earned the right to a quiet life and a few creature comforts. well Reactions not what they were, I see. What would the Death Eaters want with a poor broken-down old buffer like me? I haven’t given them the chance. I’ve been on the move for a year. Never stay in one place more than a week. Correct, I might have been in hiding, but some funny rumors have reached me since Dolores Umbridge left! If that’s how you treat teachers these days — That’s what she did, did she? Idiotic woman. Never liked her. Are you leaving? Oh, Second on the left down the hall. Don’t think I don’t know why he’s brought you, You look very like your father. Except for your eyes. You’ve got — You shouldn’t have favorites as a teacher, of course, but she was one of mine. Your mother, Lily Evans. One of the brightest I ever taught. Vivacious, you know. Charming girl. I used to tell her she ought to have been in my House. Very cheeky answers I used to get back too. I was Head of Slytherin, Oh, now, don’t go holding that against me! You’ll be Gryffindor like her, I suppose? Yes, it usually goes in families. Not always, though. Ever heard of Sirius Black? You must have done — been in the papers for the last couple of years — died a few weeks ago — well The whole Black family had been in my House, but Sirius ended up in Gryffindor! Shame — he was a talented boy. I got his brother, Regulus, when he came along, but I’d have liked the set. Your mother was Muggle-born, of course. Couldn’t believe it when I found out. Thought she must have been pure-blood, she was so good. Funny how that sometimes happens, isn’t it? All ex-students, all signed. You’ll notice Barnabas Cuffe, editor of the Daily Prophet, he’s always interested to hear my take on the day’s news. And Ambrosius Flume, of Honeydukes — a hamper every birthday, and all because I was able to give him an introduction to Ciceron Harkiss, who gave him his first job! And at the back — you’ll see her if you just crane your neck — that’s Gwenog Jones, who of course captains the Holyhead Harpies. . . . People are always astonished to hear I’m on first-name terms with the Harpies, and free tickets whenever I want them! Of course not, I have been out of touch with everybody for a year. Still . . . the prudent wizard keeps his head down in such times. All very well for Dumbledore to talk, but taking up a post at Hogwarts just now would be tantamount to declaring my public allegiance to the Order of the Phoenix! And while I’m sure they’re very admirable and brave and all the rest of it, I don’t personally fancy the mortality rate — Well, yes And I suppose one could argue that as I have not joined the Death Eaters, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named can hardly count me a friend . . . in which case, I might well be safer a little closer to Albus. . . . I cannot pretend that Amelia Bones’s death did not shake me. . . . If she, with all her Ministry contacts and protection . . . Oh, there you are, Albus, You’ve been a very long time. Upset stomach? You’re leaving? Lost . . . ? Yes . . . well . . . very gracious . . . as I say . . . All right, all right, I’ll do it! Yes, yes, I must be mad, but yes. Yes, I daresay you will, “I’ll want a pay rise, Dumbledore!” Good gracious, it’s getting dark already! I didn’t notice that they’d lit the lamps! You’d better go and change into your robes, all of you. McLaggen, you must drop by and borrow that book on nogtails. Harry, Blaise — any time you’re passing. Same goes for you, miss, Well, off you go, off you go! Now then, now then, now then, Scales out, everyone, and potion kits, and don’t forget your copies of Advanced Potion-Making. . . . Harry, m’boy? Ah, yes, Professor McGonagall did mention . . . not to worry, my dear boy, not to worry at all. You can use ingredients from the store cupboard today, and I’m sure we can lend you some scales, and we’ve got a small stock of old books here, they’ll do until you can write to Flourish and Blotts. . . . Now then, I’ve prepared a few potions for you to have a look at, just out of interest, you know. These are the kind of thing you ought to be able to make after completing your N.E.W.T.s. You ought to have heard of ’em, even if you haven’t made ’em yet. Anyone tell me what this one is? Very good, very good! Now, this one here is pretty well known. . . . Featured in a few Ministry leaflets lately too . . . Who can — ? Now then, Now, this one here . . . yes, my dear? It is indeed. It seems almost foolish to ask, but I assume you know what it does? Quite right! You recognized it, I suppose, by its distinctive mother-of-pearl sheen? May I ask your name, my dear? Granger? Granger? Can you possibly be related to Hector Dagworth-Granger, who founded the Most Extraordinary Society of Potioneers? Oho! ‘One of my best friends is Muggle-born, and she’s the best in our year! ’ I’m assuming this is the very friend of whom you spoke, Harry? Well, well, take twenty well-earned points for Gryffindor, Miss Granger, Amortentia doesn’t really create love, of course. It is impossible to manufacture or imitate love. No, this will simply cause a powerful infatuation or obsession. It is probably the most dangerous and powerful potion in this room — oh yes, When you have seen as much of life as I have, you will not underestimate the power of obsessive love. . . . Now, it is time for us to start work. Oho, that you know what Felix Felicis does, Miss Granger? Quite right, take another ten points for Gryffindor. Yes, it’s a funny little potion, Felix Felicis, Desperately tricky to make, and disastrous to get wrong. However, if brewed correctly, as this has been, you will find that all your endeavors tend to succeed . . . at least until the effects wear off. Because if taken in excess, it causes giddiness, recklessness, and dangerous overconfidence, Too much of a good thing, you know . . . highly toxic in large quantities. But taken sparingly, and very occasionally . . . Twice in my life, Once when I was twenty-four, once when I was fifty-seven. Two tablespoonfuls taken with breakfast. Two perfect days. And that, is what I shall be offering as a prize in this lesson. One tiny bottle of Felix Felicis, Enough for twelve hours’ luck. From dawn till dusk, you will be lucky in everything you attempt. So the winner is to use it on an ordinary day only . . . and watch how that ordinary day becomes extraordinary! Now then, how are you to win my fabulous prize? Well, by turning to page ten of Advanced Potion-Making. We have a little over an hour left to us, which should be time for you to make a decent attempt at the Draught of Living Death. I know it is more complex than anything you have attempted before, and I do not expect a perfect potion from anybody. The person who does best, however, will win little Felix here. Off you go! Yes, I was sorry to hear he had died, although of course it wasn’t unexpected, dragon pox at his age. . . . And time’s . . . up! Stop stirring, please! Harry! Excellent, excellent, Harry! Good lord, it’s clear you’ve inherited your mother’s talent. She was a dab hand at Potions, Lily was! Here you are, then, here you are — one bottle of Felix Felicis, as promised, and use it well! Harry, Harry, just the man I was hoping to see! I was hoping to catch you before dinner! What do you say to a spot of supper tonight in my rooms instead? Oh dear! Dear, dear, I was counting on you, Harry! Well, now, I’ll just have to have a word with Severus and explain the situation. I’m sure I’ll be able to persuade him to postpone your detention. Yes, I’ll see you both later! Harry, m’boy! Harry, that’s three of my little suppers you’ve missed now! It won’t do, m’boy, I’m determined to have you! Miss Granger loves them, don’t you? So why don’t you come along, Harry? Well, I certainly expect you to win your first match after all this hard work! But a little recreation never hurt anybody. Now, how about Monday night, you can’t possibly want to practice in this weather. . . . Unlucky again! Ah, well . . . you can’t evade me forever, Harry! Harry, m’boy! Come in, come in, so many people I’d like you to meet! Harry, I’d like you to meet Eldred Worple, an old student of mine, author of Blood Brothers: My Life Amongst the Vampires — and, of course, his friend Sanguini. Ah, Sybill, we all think our subject’s most important! But I don’t think I’ve ever known such a natural at Potions! Instinctive, you know — like his mother! I’ve only ever taught a few with this kind of ability, I can tell you that, Sybill — why even Severus — Stop skulking and come and join us, Severus! I was just talking about Harry’s exceptional potion-making! Some credit must go to you, of course, you taught him for five years! Well, then, it’s natural ability! You should have seen what he gave me, first lesson, Draught of Living Death — never had a student produce finer on a first attempt, I don’t think even you, Severus — Remind me what other subjects you’re taking, Harry? And a great one you’ll make too! That’s all right, Argus, that’s all right, It’s Christmas, and it’s not a crime to want to come to a party. Just this once, we’ll forget any punishment; you may stay, Draco. It’s nothing, nothing, I did know your grandfather, after all. . . . Oh, now, Severus, it’s Christmas, don’t be too hard — Settle down, settle down, please! Quickly, now, lots of work to get through this afternoon! Golpalott’s Third Law . . . who can tell me — ? But Miss Granger can, of course! Precisely! Ten points for Gryffindor! Now, if we accept Golpalott’s Third Law as true . . . . . . which means, of course, that assuming we have achieved correct identification of the potion’s ingredients by Scarpin’s Revelaspell, our primary aim is not the relatively simple one of selecting antidotes to those ingredients in and of themselves, but to find that added component that will, by an almost alchemical process, transform these disparate elements — . . . and so, I want each of you to come and take one of these phials from my desk. You are to create an antidote for the poison within it before the end of the lesson. Good luck, and don’t forget your protective gloves! Two minutes left, everyone! Time’s . . . UP! Well, let’s see how you’ve done! Blaise . . . what have you got for me? And you, Harry, What have you got to show me? You’ve got nerve, boy! Oh, you’re like your mother. . . . Well, I can’t fault you. . . . A bezoar would certainly act as an antidote to all these potions! That’s the individual spirit a real potion-maker needs! Just like his mother, she had the same intuitive grasp of potion-making, it’s undoubtedly from Lily he gets it. . . . Yes, Harry, yes, if you’ve got a bezoar to hand, of course that would do the trick . . . although as they don’t work on everything, and are pretty rare, it’s still worth knowing how to mix antidotes. . . . Time to pack up! And an extra ten points to Gryffindor for sheer cheek! Harry, This is very early for a call. . . . I generally sleep late on a Saturday. . . . Harry, Was this potion within date? They can strengthen, you know, the longer they’re kept. Oh, all right, come in, then, come in, I’ve got the necessary here in my bag, it’s not a difficult antidote. . . . Very handsome, Now drink that up, it’s a tonic for the nerves, keep you calm when she arrives, you know. Don’t mention it, m’boy, don’t mention it, Pick-me-up, that’s what he needs, I’ve got butterbeer, I’ve got wine, I’ve got one last bottle of this oak-matured mead . . . hmm . . . Why don’t we open it now and celebrate Mr. Weasley’s birthday? Nothing like a fine spirit to chase away the pangs of disappointed love. . . . There you are then, Well, a very happy birthday, Ralph — — and may you have many more — What — but — All too young to Apparate just yet? Not turned seventeen yet? Ah well, as we’re so few, we’ll do something fun. I want you all to brew me up something amusing! Oh, surprise me, Well, now, this looks absolutely wonderful, Euphoria, I take it? And what’s that I smell? Mmmm . . . you’ve added just a sprig of peppermint, haven’t you? . . . I really don’t know where you get these brain waves, my boy . . . unless — — it’s just your mother’s genes coming out in you! I do thank you for taking the time, Pomona, most authorities agree that they are at their most efficacious if picked at twilight. Plenty, plenty, This should allow for a few leaves for each of my third years, and some to spare if anybody over-stews them. . . . Well, good evening to you, and many thanks again! Merlin’s beard, Harry, you made me jump, How did you get out of the castle? I’ll be reporting that man, he’s more concerned about litter than proper security if you ask me. . . . But why are you out here, Harry? Hagrid But I know that Dumbledore trusts Hagrid to the hilt, so I’m sure he can’t be up to anything very dreadful. . . . I heard rumors there were acromantulas in the forest, It’s true, then? But acromantula venom is very valuable . . . If the beast only just died it might not yet have dried out. . . . Of course, I wouldn’t want to do anything insensitive if Hagrid is upset . . . but if there was any way to procure some . . . I mean, it’s almost impossible to get venom from an acromantula while it’s alive. . . . . . . seems an awful waste not to collect it . . . might get a hundred Galleons a pint. . . . To be frank, my salary is not large. . . . Yes, of course, I tell you what, Harry, I’ll meet you down there with a bottle or two. . . . We’ll drink the poor beast’s — well — not health — but we’ll send it off in style, anyway, once it’s buried. And I’ll change my tie, this one is a little exuberant for the occasion. . . . So very sorry to hear of your loss. Wouldn’t have dreamed of it, Sad night, sad night . . . Where is the poor creature? Magnificent, My dear Hagrid, I revere them, Now . . . shall we proceed to the burial? Of course, it’s difficult for you, who knew him best, Farewell, Aragog, king of arachnids, whose long and faithful friendship those who knew you won’t forget! Though your body will decay, your spirit lingers on in the quiet, web-spun places of your forest home. May your many-eyed descendants ever flourish and your human friends find solace for the loss they have sustained. Let’s get inside and have a drink. Get on his other side, Harry. . . . That’s it. . . . Up you come, Hagrid . . . Well done . . . I have had it all tested for poison, Had a house-elf taste every bottle after what happened to your poor friend Rupert. One for Harry . . . . . . and one for me. Well to Aragog. Aragog, Sweet,  But my dear chap, do you know how much that’s worth? Yes, indeed, Parry Otter, the Chosen Boy Who — well — something of that sort, To friendship! To generosity! To ten Galleons a hair! Sorry, Can’t carry a tune to save my life. Oh, Oh dear. Yes, that was — was terrible indeed. Terrible . .. terrible . . . I don’t — don’t suppose you remember it, Harry? I — I didn’t, Oh, She could have . . . she needn’t . . . That’s awful. . . . That’s enough! Really, my dear boy, enough . . . I’m an old man . . . I don’t need to hear . . . I don’t want to hear . . . Liked her? I don’t imagine anyone who met her wouldn’t have liked her. . . . Very brave . . . Very funny . . . It was the most horrible thing. . . . Don’t say that, It isn’t a question . . . If it were to help you, of course . . . but no purpose can be served . . . You are the Chosen One? But then . . . my dear boy . . . you’re asking a great deal . . . you’re asking me, in fact, to aid you in your attempt to destroy — Harry, Harry, of course I do, but — I am not proud . . . I am ashamed of what — of what that memory shows. . . . I think I may have done great damage that day. . . . You’re a good boy, And you’ve got her eyes. . . . Just don’t think too badly of me once you’ve seen it. . . . Tom, Tom, if I knew I couldn’t tell you, What with your uncanny ability to know things you shouldn’t, and your careful flattery of the people who matter — thank you for the pineapple, by the way, you’re quite right, it is my favorite — — I confidently expect you to rise to Minister of Magic within twenty years. Nonsense, couldn’t be plainer you come from decent Wizarding stock, abilities like yours. No, you’ll go far, Tom, I’ve never been wrong about a student yet. Good gracious, is it that time already? You’d better get going, boys, or we’ll all be in trouble. Lestrange, I want your essay by tomorrow or it’s detention. Same goes for you, Avery. Look sharp, Tom, you don’t want to be caught out of bed out of hours, and you a prefect . . . Ask away, then, m’boy, ask away. . . . Project for Defense Against the Dark Arts, is it? Well, well, it can’t hurt to give you an overview, of course. Just so that you understand the term. A Horcrux is the word used for an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul. Well, you split your soul, you see, and hide part of it in an object outside the body. Then, even if one’s body is attacked or destroyed, one cannot die, for part of the soul remains earthbound and undamaged. But of course, existence in such a form . . . . . . few would want it, Tom, very few. Death would be preferable. Well, you must understand that the soul is supposed to remain intact and whole. Splitting it is an act of violation, it is against nature. By an act of evil — the supreme act of evil. By committing murder. Killing rips the soul apart. The wizard intent upon creating a Horcrux would use the damage to his advantage: He would encase the torn portion — There is a spell, do not ask me, I don’t know! Do I look as though I have tried it — do I look like a killer? Not at all, not at all, not offended, It’s natural to feel some curiosity about these things. . . . Wizards of a certain caliber have always been drawn to that aspect of magic. . . . Merlin’s beard, Tom! Seven! Isn’t it bad enough to think of killing one person? . . bad enough to divide the soul . . . but to rip it into seven pieces . . . Of course, this is all hypothetical, what we’re discussing, isn’t it? All academic . . . But all the same, Tom . . . keep it quiet, what I’ve told — that’s to say, what we’ve discussed. People wouldn’t like to think we’ve been chatting about Horcruxes. It’s a banned subject at Hogwarts, you know. . . . Dumbledore’s particularly fierce about it. . . . Snape! Snape! I taught him! I thought I knew him! But will we have a single pupil after this? Parents will want to keep their children at home and I can’t say I blame them. Harry! My dear boy . . . what a surprise . . . Minerva, do please explain. . . . Severus . . . what . . . ? My word, What a to-do! I’m not at all sure whether this is wise, Minerva. He is bound to find a way in, you know, and anyone who has tried to delay him will be in most grievous peril — Minerva!",

Oh, my dear, you know as well as I do how much information can be generated by a fat bag of Galleons, a refusal to hear the word ‘no,’ and a nice sharp Quick-Quotes Quill! People were queuing to dish the dirt on Dumbledore anyway. Not everyone thought he was so wonderful, you know — he trod on an awful lot of important toes. Now, come off it, Betty, I’m not giving away all the highlights before anybody’s bought the book! But I can promise that anybody who still thinks Dumbledore was white as his beard is in for a rude awakening! Let’s just say that nobody hearing him rage against You-Know-Who would have dreamed that he dabbled in the Dark Arts himself in his youth! And for a wizard who spent his later years pleading for tolerance, he wasn’t exactly broad-minded when he was younger! Yes, Albus Dumbledore had an extremely murky past, not to mention that very fishy family, which he worked so hard to keep hushed up. Oh, now, I’m glad you mentioned Grindelwald, I’m afraid those who go dewy-eyed over Dumbledore’s spectacular victory must brace themselves for a bombshell — or perhaps a Dungbomb. Very dirty business indeed. All I’ll say is, don’t be so sure that there really was the spectacular duel of legend. After they’ve read my book, people may be forced to conclude that Grindelwald simply conjured a white handkerchief from the end of his wand and came quietly! Oh yes, I devote an entire chapter to the whole Potter–Dumbledore relationship. It’s been called unhealthy, even sinister. Again, your readers will have to buy my book for the whole story, but there is no question that Dumbledore took an unnatural interest in Potter from the word go. Whether that was really in the boy’s best interests — well, we’ll see. It’s certainly an open secret that Potter has had a most troubled adolescence. Oh, yes, we’ve developed a close bond, Poor Potter has few real friends, and we met at one of the most testing moments of his life — the Triwizard Tournament. I am probably one of the only people alive who can say that they know the real Harry Potter. Well, I don’t want to say too much — it’s all in the book — but eyewitnesses inside Hogwarts castle saw Potter running away from the scene moments after Dumbledore fell, jumped, or was pushed. Potter later gave evidence against Severus Snape, a man against whom he has a notorious grudge. Is everything as it seems? That is for the Wizarding community to decide — once they’ve read my book.",

Harry, Rita Skeeter is a dreadful — Hello, Muriel, Yes, we were just discussing — Ill-informed sniping, I’m sorry you think so, I assure you I was writing from the heart. Muriel! Untrue! Absolutely untrue! The reason Albus never spoke about Ariana, is, I should have thought, quite clear. He was so devastated by her death — She never pretended anything of the sort! Kendra was a fine woman, Ariana was not a Squib! I tell you, that’s not what happened! Really, Muriel, how you can possibly know whether — How can you, Muriel? A mother kill her own daughter? Think what you are saying! Oh, no doubt Ariana murdered her, Why not? Yes I was, And a more desperately sad occasion I cannot remember. Albus was heartbroken — How do you — ? Yes I was, A most gifted magical historian and an old friend of Albus’s.

I thought they didn’t know you were being moved tonight, I thought — Well, we know our protective charms hold, then, don’t we?

So, you three have been on the run how long? Knew they were coming for me, Heard Death Eaters were in the area last week and decided I’d better run for it. Refused to register as a Muggle-born on principle, see, so I knew it was a matter of time, knew I’d have to leave in the end. My wife should be okay, she’s pure-blood. And then I met Dean here, what, a few days ago, son? I’ve got to say, Dirk, I’m surprised to run into you. Pleased, but surprised. Word was you’d been caught. And where do you two fit in? I, er, had the impression the goblins were for You-Know-Who, on the whole. How come you’re in hiding, then? What? What about you, Griphook? Good man — goblin, I should say, Didn’t manage to lock a Death Eater up in one of the old high-security vaults, I suppose? Dean and I are still missing something here, Never heard a word, Not in the Prophet, was it? Ah, God bless ’em, What did they think, that they’d be able to use the sword on You-Know-Who? Or on Snape himself? I’m still not seeing the joke, The sword of Gryffindor! I see, And I take it you didn’t bother telling the Death Eaters this? They’re okay, though? I mean, the Weasleys don’t need any more of their kids injured, do they? Lucky for them, With Snape’s track record I suppose we should just be glad they’re still alive. ’Course I do, You’re not going to sit there and tell me you think Potter had anything to do with it? I don’t know. You want to give it a look. Xeno is printing all the stuff the Prophet’s ignoring, not a single mention of Crumple-Horned Snorkacks in the last issue. How long they’ll let him get away with it, mind, I don’t know. But Xeno says, front page of every issue, that any wizard who’s against You-Know-Who ought to make helping Harry Potter their number-one priority.

Oh, I love her, always read her! She’s written a book about Dumbledore, you know! You there! Give me your chair, I’m a hundred and seven! Hello again, Barry, or whatever your name is, Now, what were you saying about Rita Skeeter, Elphias? You know she’s written a biography of Dumbledore? I can’t wait to read it, I must remember to place an order at Flourish and Blotts! There’s no need to look like a pair of stuffed frogs! Before he became so respected and respectable and all that tosh, there were some mighty funny rumors about Albus! You would say that, Elphias, I noticed how you skated over the sticky patches in that obituary of yours! Oh, we all know you worshipped Dumbledore; I daresay you’ll still think he was a saint even if it does turn out that he did away with his Squib sister! Thought wrong, then, didn’t you, Barry! Anyway, how could you expect to know anything about it? It all happened years and years before you were even thought of, my dear, and the truth is that those of us who were alive then never knew what really happened. That’s why I can’t wait to find out what Skeeter’s unearthed! Dumbledore kept that sister of his quiet for a long time! And why on earth would he tell you? Why did nobody ever see her, Elphias? Why did half of us never even know she existed, until they carried the coffin out of the house and held a funeral for her? Where was saintly Albus while Ariana was locked in the cellar? Off being brilliant at Hogwarts, and never mind what was going on in his own house! Dumbledore’s mother was a terrifying woman, simply terrifying. Muggle-born, though I heard she pretended otherwise — — proud and very domineering, the sort of witch who would have been mortified to produce a Squib — So you say, Elphias, but explain, then, why she never attended Hogwarts! In our day, Squibs were often hushed up, though to take it to the extreme of actually imprisoning a little girl in the house and pretending she didn’t exist — Squibs were usually shipped off to Muggle schools and encouraged to integrate into the Muggle community . . . much kinder than trying to find them a place in the Wizarding world, where they must always be second class; but naturally Kendra Dumbledore wouldn’t have dreamed of letting her daughter go to a Muggle school — — to permit her to leave the house? And yet she was never taken to St. Mungo’s and no Healer was ever summoned to see her! For your information, Elphias, my cousin Lancelot was a Healer at St. Mungo’s at the time, and he told my family in strictest confidence that Ariana had never been seen there. All most suspicious, Lancelot thought! Now, if Kendra hadn’t died first, If the mother in question was capable of imprisoning her daughter for years on end, why not? But as I say, it doesn’t fit, because Kendra died before Ariana — of what, nobody ever seemed sure — Why not? Yeah, Shake your head all you like, Elphias! You were at Ariana’s funeral, were you not? His heart wasn’t the only thing. Didn’t Aberforth break Albus’s nose halfway through the service? My mother was friendly with old Bathilda Bagshot, Bathilda described the whole thing to Mother while I was listening at the door. A coffin-side brawl! The way Bathilda told it, Aberforth shouted that it was all Albus’s fault that Ariana was dead and then punched him in the face. According to Bathilda, Albus did not even defend himself, and that’s odd enough in itself, Albus could have destroyed Aberforth in a duel with both hands tied behind his back. Quite gaga these days, I’ve heard, Oh, there are ways of bringing back memories, and I’m sure Rita Skeeter knows them all, But even if Bathilda’s completely cuckoo, I’m sure she’d still have old photographs, maybe even letters. She knew the Dumbledores for years. . . . Well worth a trip to Godric’s Hollow, I’d have thought. Yes I was, The Dumbledores moved there after Percival was imprisoned, and she was their neighbor.

About the kids who tried to steal Gryffindor’s sword out of Snape’s office at Hogwarts? Hardly, One of the kids who tried to take the sword was Bill’s younger sister. She and a couple of friends got into Snape’s office and smashed open the glass case where he was apparently keeping the sword. Snape caught them as they were trying to smuggle it down the staircase. Well, whatever they thought they were going to do with it, Snape decided the sword wasn’t safe where it was, Couple of days later, once he’d got the say-so from You-Know-Who, I imagine, he sent it down to London to be kept in Gringotts instead. You believe that story, then, do you, Ted? You believe Snape killed Dumbledore? Hard to know what to believe these days, Yeah, The Quibbler? That lunatic rag of Xeno Lovegood’s?

Quickly! You’d better come up, Excuse me, Why have you come here? It is the horn of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack, The Crumple-Horned Snorkack, is a shy and highly magical creature, and its horn — I bought it, two weeks ago, from a delightful young wizard who knew of my interest in the exquisite Snorkack. A Christmas surprise for my Luna. Now, why exactly have you come here, Mr. Potter? Ah, Help. Hmm. Yes. The thing is . The thing is. . helping Harry Potter . . . rather dangerous . . . Yeah, However — Fine, She . . . she will like to see you. I’ll go and call her and then — yes, very well. I shall try to help you. That’s right, You haven’t heard of them? I’m not surprised. Very, very few wizards believe. Witness that knuckleheaded young man at your brother’s wedding, who attacked me for sporting the symbol of a well-known Dark wizard! Such ignorance. There is nothing Dark about the Hallows — at least, not in that crude sense. One simply uses the symbol to reveal oneself to other believers, in the hope that they might help one with the Quest. Well, you see, believers seek the Deathly Hallows, I assume that you are all familiar with ‘The Tale of the Three Brothers’? Well, well, Mr. Potter, the whole thing starts with ‘The Tale of the Three Brothers’ . . . I have a copy somewhere. . . . The original? Well then, why don’t you read it aloud? Much the best way to make sure we all understand. Those are the Deathly Hallows, Together, the Deathly Hallows. That’s right, That is a children’s tale, told to amuse rather than to instruct. Those of us who understand these matters, however, recognize that the ancient story refers to three objects, or Hallows, which, if united, will make the possessor master of Death. Luna ought to have enough Plimpies soon, Master, Conqueror. Vanquisher. Whichever term you prefer. Well, of course. Luna has told me all about you, young lady, You are, I gather, not unintelligent, but painfully limited. Narrow. Close-minded. Ah, but the Third Hallow is a true Cloak of Invisibility, Miss Granger! I mean to say, it is not a traveling cloak imbued with a Disillusionment Charm, or carrying a Bedazzling Hex, or else woven from Demiguise hair, which will hide one initially but fade with the years until it turns opaque. We are talking about a cloak that really and truly renders the wearer completely invisible, and endures eternally, giving constant and impenetrable concealment, no matter what spells are cast at it. How many cloaks have you ever seen like that, Miss Granger? Exactly, None of you have ever seen such a thing. The possessor would be immeasurably rich, would he not? What of it? Prove that it is not, That’s right, I am glad to see that you are opening your mind a little. Oh, well, in that case there is endless evidence, The Elder Wand is the Hallow that is most easily traced, because of the way in which it passes from hand to hand. Which is that the possessor of the wand must capture it from its previous owner, if he is to be truly master of it, Surely you have heard of the way the wand came to Egbert the Egregious, after his slaughter of Emeric the Evil? Of how Godelot died in his own cellar after his son, Hereward, took the wand from him? Of the dreadful Loxias, who took the wand from Barnabas Deverill, whom he had killed? The bloody trail of the Elder Wand is splattered across the pages of Wizarding history. Alas, who knows? Who knows where the Elder Wand lies hidden? The trail goes cold with Arcus and Livius. Who can say which of them really defeated Loxias, and which took the wand? And who can say who may have defeated them? History, alas, does not tell us. But you have been misleading me, young woman! Many of us Questers believe that the Peverells have everything — everything! — to do with the Hallows! Exactly! The sign of the Deathly Hallows on Ignotus’s grave is conclusive proof! Why, that the three brothers in the story were actually the three Peverell brothers, Antioch, Cadmus, and Ignotus! That they were the original owners of the Hallows! Of what? They took my Luna, Because of what I’ve been writing. They took my Luna and I don’t know where she is, what they’ve done to her. But they might give her back to me if I — if I — They will be here at any moment. I must save Luna. I cannot lose Luna. You must not leave. No . . . no . . . upstairs . . . Potter! No — no — I beg you! It really is Potter! Really! I swear . . . I swear . . . Potter’s upstairs! It’s Potter, I tell you, it’s Potter! Please . . . please . . . give me Luna, just let me have Luna. . . .",

What happened to you, ugly?” What’s your name? And your first name? Check the list, Scabior, And what about you, ginger? A Weasley? So you’re related to blood traitors even if you’re not a Mudblood. And lastly, your pretty little friend . . . Oh, I’m not going to bite just yet. We’ll see if she’s a bit quicker at remembering her name than Barny. Who are you, girly? What’s your blood status? A Weasley? The Order of the Phoenix. Mean anything to you? Well, they don’t show the Dark Lord proper respect, so the name’s been Tabooed. A few Order members have been tracked that way. Not a bad little haul for one night, A Mudblood, a runaway goblin, and three truants. You checked their names on the list yet, Scabior? Interesting, That’s interesting. So you aren’t wanted, then, Vernon? Or are you on that list under a different name? What House were you in at Hogwarts? Well, well, If you’re telling the truth, ugly, you’ve got nothing to fear from a trip to the Ministry. I expect your father’ll reward us just for picking you up. Ve-e-ry nice, Oh, very nice indeed. You know what, little girly? This picture looks a hell of a lot like you. Well, this changes things, doesn’t it?”whispered Greyback What’s that on your forehead, Vernon? I thought you wore glasses, Potter? It is! We’ve caught Potter! To hell with the Ministry, They’ll take the credit, and we won’t get a look in. I say we take him straight to You-Know-Who. No, I haven’t got — they say he’s using the Malfoys’ place as a base. We’ll take the boy there. Who’s in charge here? I say that’s Potter, and him plus his wand, that’s two hundred thousand Galleons right there! But if you’re too gutless to come along, any of you, it’s all for me, and with any luck, I’ll get the girl thrown in! Might as well take the lot. We’ve got two Mudbloods, that’s another ten Galleons.

You send dementors down my street, I’ll send a Patronus back at ’em! I’m not having ’em near me, I’ve told you that, I’m not having it! Stag! Stag! You idiot — Expecto Patronum! If I want to put my cat out, I will, and be damned to your curfew! What if I did? Going to cart me off to Azkaban? Kill me for sticking my nose out my own front door? Do it, then, if you want to! But I hope for your sakes you haven’t pressed your little Dark Marks and summoned him. He’s not going to like being called here for me and my old cat, is he, now? And where will you lot traffick potions and poisons when my pub’s closed down? What’ll happen to your little sidelines then? I keep my mouth shut, it’s why you come here, isn’t it? Stag? It’s a goat, idiot! You bloody fools, What were you thinking, coming here? It’s your eye I’ve been seeing in the mirror. Thought he’d be with you. Where’ve you left him? I’m sorry to hear it. I liked that elf. Bought it from Dung ’bout a year ago, Albus told me what it was. Been trying to keep an eye out for you. What are you talking about? Brains like that, you could be a Death Eater, son. Haven’t I just proved my Patronus is a goat? I got food, Yes, Been reading Rita Skeeter, have you, missy? That old berk, Thought the sun shone out of my brother’s every orifice, he did. Well, so did plenty of people, you three included, by the looks of it. Oh, don’t I? Funny thing, how many of the people my brother cared about very much ended up in a worse state than if he’d left ’em well alone. Never you mind, When my sister was six years old, she was attacked, set upon, by three Muggle boys. They’d seen her doing magic, spying through the back garden hedge: She was a kid, she couldn’t control it, no witch or wizard can at that age. What they saw scared them, I expect. They forced their way through the hedge, and when she couldn’t show them the trick, they got a bit carried away trying to stop the little freak doing it. It destroyed her, what they did: She was never right again. She wouldn’t use magic, but she couldn’t get rid of it; it turned inward and drove her mad, it exploded out of her when she couldn’t control it and at times she was strange and dangerous.But mostly she was sweet and scared and harmless. And my father went after the bastards that did it, and attacked them. And they locked him up in Azkaban for it. He never said why he’d done it, because if the Ministry had known what Ariana had become, she’d have been locked up in St. Mungo’s for good. They’d have seen her as a serious threat to the International Statute of Secrecy, unbalanced like she was, with magic exploding out of her at moments when she couldn’t keep it in any longer. We had to keep her safe and quiet. We moved house, put it about she was ill, and my mother looked after her, and tried to keep her calm and happy. I was her favorite, Then, when she was fourteen . . . See, I wasn’t there, If I’d been there, I could have calmed her down. She had one of her rages, and my mother wasn’t as young as she was, and . . . it was an accident. Ariana couldn’t control it.But my mother was killed. So that put paid to Albus’s trip round the world with little Doge. The pair of ’em came home for my mother’s funeral and then Doge went off on his own, and Albus settled down as head of the family. Ha! I’d have looked after her, I told him so, I didn’t care about school, I’d have stayed home and done it. He told me I had to finish my education and he’d take over from my mother. But he did all right for a few weeks . . . till he came. Grindelwald. And at last, my brother had an equal to talk to, someone just as bright and talented as he was. And looking after Ariana took a backseat then, while they were hatching all their plans for a new Wizarding order, and looking for Hallows, and whatever else it was they were so interested in. But after a few weeks of it, I’d had enough, I had. It was nearly time for me to go back to Hogwarts, so I told ’em, both of ’em, face-to-face, like I am to you, now, I told him, you’d better give it up now. You can’t move her, she’s in no fit state, you can’t take her with you, wherever it is you’re planning to go, when you’re making your clever speeches, trying to whip yourselves up a following. He didn’t like that, Grindelwald didn’t like that at all. He got angry. He told me what a stupid little boy I was, trying to stand in the way of him and my brilliant brother .. Didn’t I understand my poor sister wouldn’t have to be hidden once they’d changed the world, and led the wizards out of hiding, and taught the Muggles their place? — and I think she wanted to help, but she didn’t really know what she was doing, and I don’t know which of us did it, it could have been any of us — and she was dead. Gone, Gone forever. ’Course, Grindelwald scarpered. He had a bit of a track record already, back in his own country, and he didn’t want Ariana set to his account too. And Albus was free, wasn’t he? Free of the burden of his sister, free to become the greatest wizard of the — I beg your pardon? How can you be sure, Potter, that my brother wasn’t more interested in the greater good than in you? How can you be sure you aren’t dispensable, just like my little sister? Why didn’t he tell him to hide, then? Why didn’t he say to him, ‘Take care of yourself, here’s how to survive’? You’re seventeen, boy! Who says I’ve given up? I don’t say I like it, but it’s the truth! Couple more? What d’you mean, a couple more, Longbottom? There’s a curfew and a Caterwauling Charm on the whole village! Look after ’em, then, I might not be able to save ’em a third time. Potter! I’ve had hundreds of kids thundering through my pub, Potter! Potter! I’ve had hundreds of kids thundering through my pub, Potter! — attacking because they haven’t handed you over, yeah, I’m not deaf, the whole of Hogsmeade heard him. And it never occurred to any of you to keep a few Slytherins hostage? There are kids of Death Eaters you’ve just sent to safety. Wouldn’t it have been a bit smarter to keep ’em here? Good girl!
